# Creation of an Application to Capture the Metadata of Big Data

## Technical Overview
- Svelte/Kit
- Electron
- Openseadragon
- Annotorious 
  - As used by [UCL's MicroPasts](https://crowdsourced.micropasts.org/)

## Process

- Concept of slow annotation --> like current slow fashion/slow creation movement
  - If project can temporally afford it (only needs a small amount of training data or has a large group working on annotation), then metadata to tracking training process to be as comprehensive as possible
  - Cite ISSAP as example of "slow annotation"?

- Applied background in UI development
  - Mapping (verify that this is correct term)
    - MS Paint
    - Excel
  - Home and save button placed reasonable distance apart to reduce risk of accidental clicks

- My Metadata
  - Encourage the user to create structured metadata for their annotations
- Extracted Metadata
  - The pre-existing metadata from the uploaded image
- Annotation metadata columns created 


Home
- User can choose to work in existing project or create new project

New Project
- User uploads collection of images they would like to annotate

Workspace
- File viewer
  - Lists uploaded image files
  - Offers ability to add or remove additional files
- Metadata viewer
  - One tab for automatically extracted data


- From homepage, user is always taken to Workspace
  - If they select "New Project" they are taken to an empty workspace with guidance on how to setup a project
  - If they select "Open Existing Project" they are immediately prompted to open the JSON file

- Deleting annotation on canvas deletes corresponding row --> direct interaction/connection between image and metadata being generated

Limitations
- Larger number of files, larger loading time --> 15000 images takes 5min to load
