# Case Study: Finding Early Modern Marginalia
- Scraping 
  - 


- Annotation and training model as an iterative process
  - Using YOLOv7 object detection model --> most specialised for real-time object detection, which makes it good at object detection even when given a small number of examples to train from 
  - Stage 1: Will manually annotate a small number of images from AOR --> the creators of this digital archive indicated which book pages have annotations, so it was very easy to obtain examples of annotated pages
    - For diversity, I also annotated a small selection of page excerpts from NLS Chapbooks archive which I uncovered in a previous object detection experiment that sought to find the woodcut illustrations present in chapbooks.
  - Stage 2: I wil use the small set of annotated images to train the model, and then apply this trained model to the Calisphere archive to generate more training data
  - Stage 3: After revising the Calisphere detections, I will perform the final training step with this additional training data and then apply this model to the NLS Chapbooks dataset.

Stage 1: Manual Annotation
- Added "Notes" category to make note of any interesting finds
  - Trying to understand what the marginalia in Coalman's Courtship is exactly --> corrections? indicated in the notes of one annotation that marginalia appears to be an alternate phrasing
    - Annotator of J&M's Courtship appears to be making the same corrections --> Same person?
    - Marginalia seems to be "updating" the language used in the story --> perhaps chapbook was created earlier in the EM period and annotator is annotating it later in EM period
    - Despite more "modern" corrections/rephrasing, there are still many pieces of this reader's marginalia that are not comprehensible to me --> this could however, be used to identify a timeframe of when/where the marginalia was composed or who it was composed by
      - Word "auld" is used --> usage of "auld" peaked in 1820s, but also Scottish/Irish/Northern England
- Find myself referencing the image/archival metadata to aid in comprehension of the marginalia itself
