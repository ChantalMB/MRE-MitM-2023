Particularly of note from this time was literary scholar George Charles Moore Smith’s work. In 1913 he published a book that aimed to “illustrate the life, character, and opinions” of early modern writer Gabriel Harvey using his “unpublished materials”, citing Harvey’s vast array of marginalia in this process of extending existing knowledge.<span class="citation"></span> More current works tend to focus on the materiality of marginalia, using a combination of their content alongside their placement and material features of the book itself to analyze how early modern readers interacted with and used literature.<span class="citation"></span> Yet regardless of scope and focus, most studies of marginalia focus on tracing select annotators or on small collections.This is at least partially due to the difficulty finding marginalia across larger collections when these annotations are not prolific and prominent. It is this issue of discoverability which my research project will seek to address.</a></li>

Rather than being “passive”, readers read with an idea of practical application in their world and the future, “reading as intended to give rise to something else.”<span class="citation"></span> Smyth refers to the inverse of an active reader, an <em>inactive</em> reader, as being found present in unmarked pages, yet I propose an inactive reader could also be defined as one who dismisses the content of the book in favour of its materiality, as something that can be repurposed as a diary or catalogue of debts (cite wigmaker’s pages). It is this genre of “inactive” reading that I attempt to find in the following case study using an object detection model applied to the NLS collection of Early Modern chapbooks printed in Scotland.<span class="citation"></span> By macroscopely analysing the marginalia of over 3000 works made for popular consumption, trends in how these booklets were used as something more than just entertaining literature can be identified.</a></li>

<li>Annotation and training model as an iterative process
<ul>
<li>Using YOLOv7 object detection model –&gt; most specialised for real-time object detection, which makes it good at object detection even when given a small number of examples to train from</li>
<li>Stage 1: Will manually annotate a small number of images from AOR –&gt; the creators of this digital archive indicated which book pages have annotations, so it was very easy to obtain examples of annotated pages
<ul>
<li>For diversity, I also annotated a small selection of page excerpts from NLS Chapbooks archive which I uncovered in a previous object detection experiment that sought to find the woodcut illustrations present in chapbooks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Stage 2: Transfer learning pt 1– freeze the backbone feature extraction layers of model and only train head layers which analyze extracted features and predict the presence, location, and class of objects in the image.
<ul>
<li>‘freeze’ refers to a process of fixing the weights of certain layers in the model during training –&gt; by freezing the layers, their weights are not updated during the training process, allowing them to retain the pre-trained knowledge.</li>
<li>Addresses the challenge of a small dataset size by leveraging a pretrained model’s backbone layers (which have learned general features from a larger dataset) while only training the head layers –&gt; approach aims to benefit from the pre-existing knowledge captured by the backbone layers while adapting the model to the specific object detection task with limited data.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Stage 3: Transfer learning pt 2– unfreeze backbone feature extraction layers so that all layers can be trained using updated head weights from previous step</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Stage 1: Manual Annotation
- Added “Notes” category to make note of any interesting finds
- Trying to understand what the marginalia in Coalman’s Courtship is exactly –&gt; corrections? indicated in the notes of one annotation that marginalia appears to be an alternate phrasing
- Annotator of J&amp;M’s Courtship appears to be making the same corrections –&gt; Same person?
- Marginalia seems to be “updating” the language used in the story –&gt; perhaps chapbook was created earlier in the EM period and annotator is annotating it later in EM period
- Despite more “modern” corrections/rephrasing, there are still many pieces of this reader’s marginalia that are not comprehensible to me –&gt; this could however, be used to identify a timeframe of when/where the marginalia was composed or who it was composed by
- Word “auld” is used –&gt; usage of “auld” peaked in 1820s, but also Scottish/Irish/Northern England
- Find myself referencing the image/archival metadata to aid in comprehension of the marginalia itself</p>
<p>Stage 2.0: Training Model Rnd1
- Trial with small number of ~250 annotated images
- Low mAP @ 0.594 but still pretty good!
- …However testing the model on unseen images reveals the flaw of primarily annotating images from AOR
- Model almost exclusively looks for marginalia on page peripherals since this is where Dee and Harvey annotated the most
- Need to diversify dataset
- Trial with small number of ~350 annotated images including Calisphere
- Somehow the model got worse with more data… time to reconsider object detection model?
- No nvm just overfitted, however the confidence scores are still very low…</p>
<ul>
<li>While writing, was easily able to refer back to the pages annotated and find examples through using the search function</li>
