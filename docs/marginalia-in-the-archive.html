<p>While studying texts of the past, it is not unusual to stumble upon evidence that a document had a ‘life’ before the archive it is currently in; numerous notes throughout the text at the bottom of the page made by the original purchaser, corrections scrawled in rough handwriting from a child using the document as reading practice, or perhaps there is even an initial on the title page left from the document’s first foray into the archive. Indeed, these markings known formally as marginalia not only served a purpose to those who created them, they also serve a purpose for historians through how they may situate a text within its history and allow for a glimpse into the public and private lives of the annotator.</p>
<p>Marginalia have been recognized as significant by scholars since as early as the 19th century, then used as a means to construct the history of earlier scholars in more detail and to expand upon their published works. Particularly of note from this time was literary scholar George Charles Moore Smith’s work. In 1913 he published a book that aimed to “illustrate the life, character, and opinions” of early modern writer Gabriel Harvey using his “unpublished materials”, citing Harvey’s vast array of marginalia in this process of extending existing knowledge.<span class="citation"><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></span> More current works tend to focus on the materiality of marginalia, using a combination of their content alongside their placement and material features of the book itself to analyze how early modern readers interacted with and used literature.<span class="citation"><a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></span> Yet regardless of scope and focus, most studies of marginalia focus on tracing select annotators or on small collections.This is at least partially due to the difficulty finding marginalia across larger collections when these annotations are not prolific and prominent. It is this issue of discoverability which my research project will seek to address.</p>
<hr />
<p>Acheson’s book raises a number of historical, cultural, and theoretical questions about books and their readers, many of which could be explored further through greater access to more obscure, both literally and figuratively, research materials such as marginalia. Adam Smyth’s contribution to <em>Early Modern English Marginalia</em> particularly emphasises this; in his chapter, he sought to identify current traits in recent works on the history of marginalia which bring to the surface a number of questions, paradoxes or gaps, through the analysis of object traces in Early Modern books.<span class="citation"><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></span> These traits-as-problems which Smyth uses to illustrate the value of attending to object traces can also be used to understand the value of integrating machine learning methods, particularly object detection, into the study of marginalia. The history of reading has often revolved around individual readers, even as early modern studies broadly have shifted away from this and towards to the coterie, and, in more recent years, to the network as the unit of cultural analysis.<span class="citation"><a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></span> This focus on biography has meant that studies of marginalia have tended to connect book annotations back to the individual who created them at the expense of other ways of organizing marginalia, such as by genre. Further expanding on the neglect of genre, the use of biography as the frame for analysing marginalia books has meant that scholars, preoccupied connecting the page marks to the reader’s life and identity, have spent less time seeking to establish fundamental histories of the marks themselves, such as where the conventions for marking books came from; in seeking to link marginalia to writing outside of the host text, Smyth posits the questions, “What category of mark or intervention are they? What is the larger group in which they belong?”<span class="citation"><a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></span> The tether which holds the study of marginalia to biography is at least in part due to the issues of discoverability that marginalia presents. Although more reliably discoverable than the trace object marks which Smyth features in his work, marginalia still demands time to be found whether the host being searched is physical or digital. Finding genre or larger categories which marginalia can be viewed through or belong to require wide reading of numerous sources in order to be defined. The automated detection of marginalia allows for large and diverse corpori to be evaluated for the presence of marginalia with little supervision and more efficiently than a researcher is able to sift through these works manually; following this quick process of identifying marginalia, researchers may then focus on the discovery of genre through analysis of the object detector’s output.</p>
<p>Another trait Smyth identifies in the study of marginalia is the assignment of the reader as “active”. Rather than being “passive”, readers read with an idea of practical application in their world and the future, “reading as intended to give rise to something else.”<span class="citation"><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></span> Smyth refers to the inverse of an active reader, an <em>inactive</em> reader, as being found present in unmarked pages, yet I propose an inactive reader could also be defined as one who dismisses the content of the book in favour of its materiality, as something that can be repurposed as a diary or catalogue of debts (cite wigmaker’s pages). It is this genre of “inactive” reading that I attempt to find in the following case study using an object detection model applied to the NLS collection of Early Modern chapbooks printed in Scotland.<span class="citation"><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></span> By macroscopely analysing the marginalia of over 3000 works made for popular consumption, trends in how these booklets were used as something more than just entertaining literature can be identified.</p>

<p>Acheson Intro
- The chapters in this volume build on earlier scholarship that established marginalia as an intellectual method (<strong>Grafton and Jardine</strong>), as records of reading motivated by cultural, social, theological, and personal inclinations (<strong>Brayman [Hackel] and Orgel</strong>), and as practices inspired by material affordances particular to the book and the pen (<strong>Fleming and Sherman</strong>). –&gt; Good ref for key scholars
- Marginalia as a mode –-&gt; set of ways in which material opportunities and practices overlap with intellectual, social, and personal motivations to make meaning in world
- Derrida’s theories about writing –&gt; Consider marginalia, first and foremost, as writing which is material, which has the power to invent things (including selves), and which exists at the intersection of generic norms and technological affordances.</p>
<p>Reading Habits and Reading Habitats; or, toward an Ecobibliography of Marginalia- Joshua Calhoun
- Lack of annotation in the early years of e-books is merely a symptom; lack of “annotatability” is the underlying condition. Just as scholars of the future might mistake a lack of annotatability for a lack of interest in annotation, scholars of early modern books tend to speak of books as either annotated or not annotated without considering whether or not the average book in England c. 1600 was annotatable in the first place.
- I wish to point out that scholars tend to assume that the presence of pen and paper equals the potential for written ex- pression.
- Paying attention to sizing—considering its absence and considering its concentration when present—we are likely to no- tice nuances in the archives that we have been missing.</p>
<p>Cut-and-Paste Bookmaking: The Private/Public Agency of Robert Nicolson
- On the other hand, we often find Nicolson engaging in curiously pri- vate practices. One of his trademark habits is to annotate a passage with a barrage of tiny marks, delivered with pinpoint accuracy to particu- lar lines of text: a period here, two periods there, elsewhere a comma or double- or triple-commas, with or without flanking periods, with crosses for points of high excitement (Figure 2.1) –&gt; At least one of these kinds of mark is merely mechanical: Nicolson adds ‘=’ signs to indicate words broken across the line-end by the printer (here again we see the annotator working as the equivalent of a type- setter).
- He becomes, in effect, a literary seismograph, offering what looks like a highly personal, line-by-line re- sponse to the rising and falling interest-levels of the text.</p>
<p>Book Marks: Object Traces in Early Modern Books
- These and the other pressed leaves, cuttings and grasses found in books in Cardiff University Special Collections, at the Beinecke in Yale, and elsewhere, are really part of a distinct category of augmented book: the book as collecting space, as box, as cabinet of natural history, the plants carefully assembled by amateur botanists and laid out on the pages.
- We meet quite frequently the inked flowers added by readers to their books, but these are normally flowers in the form of marginal annota- tions, flowers sketched by hand, evidenced, most canonically, in books owned by Ben Jonson,11 but widespread in general. Such instances of flowers-as-annotations exhibit a twin pull between the functional and the aesthetic. That is, the role of the drawn flower, like the manicule or asterisk, is primarily to mark out a passage of text; but readers seem of- ten to have felt a competing aesthetic impulse to make the flower (or the pointing finger) a vivid, humorous or spectacular intervention.
- Interpretative pull and push –&gt; the pull to read all marks symbolically, the push that recognizes there is no intent
- <strong><em>In an age where full-text dig- ital transcriptions enable near-instantaneous word and phrase searches (a kind of reading that doesn’t always produce good work), object marks present instances of resistance. They demand time in order to be found – and in thus encouraging slow, digressive, wide reading, object traces re- mind us of certain reading methods we would be foolish to abandon.
- One of the problems of histories of reading is always that the ar- chive of reading-as-inwardness is elusive: and so a defining paradox of studies of reading that draw on marginalia is that they are in fact, and necessarily, studies of writing, reflecting on those moments not when readers read, but when readers wrote in books. Of course such moments are often intimately related to reading, but they are not the same, sepa- rated as they must be by at the very least a temporal lag: to make a note is to read and then, some time later, to write. It is thus not surprising that recent work on early modern reading has argued that ideas of use and application are central, and has warned of the perils of conceiving read- ing as romantic interiority: the nature of the marks being studied frames reading as not an internal but an external pursuit.
- </em></strong>The close analysis of, typically, a particular reader has meant that the history of read- ing, as a field, has often been organized around biography precisely at a time when early modern studies more generally has been moving away from the individual as the unit of cultural analysis, with a shift in the 1990s and 2000s to the coterie, and, in more recent years, to the network. The dominance of biography and of the individual for histories of book use has meant that studies of marginal anno- tations have tended to link book annotations back to the marking individual at the expense of other ways of organizing marginalia, such as genre (see below), either by reading the marks as expressions of selfhood (“even the most routine marking of a text allows us to hear the voice of the reader”45), or by connecting the markings to the social or political interests of the reader.46 Studies of objects can be useful because they suspend these biographical assumptions – the mark of an object is less obviously expressive of a reader, and less suited to biographical interpretation – and so encourage other ways of thinking about book use.
- The use of biography as the frame for reading marked books has meant critics, preoccupied with readers’ marks in terms of the reader’s identity or life, have spent less time in establishing where the conventions for marking books come from.
- It would be profitable to place early modern annotations in relation to particular generic precedents, such as humanist dialogues, pedagogical works, devo- tional forms like the catechism, and autobiographical texts: such placements would helpfully connect the specific marginalia to writing other than the host text. Object marks raise this question of genre and influence in an extreme form: what category of mark or intervention are they? What is the larger group in which they belong?
- The “active” reader. One of the most common arguments in studies of marginal annotations in the early modern period and beyond, is that readers were “active” (or sometimes “radical”), rather than “passive,” by which is meant generally that readers marked books in pursuit of their own agenda, that readers read with an idea of practical application in the world, that readers were concerned with future uses of the text rather than with authorial intention or orig- inal significance (with “reading as intended to give rise to some- thing else”),48 that readers were quick to depart from prescribed interpretations.
- ***Smyth refers to the inverse of an active reader, an inactive reader, as being present in unmarked pages, yet an inactive reader could also be defined as one who dismisses the content of the book in favour of its materiality, as something that can be repurposed as a diary or catalogue of debts (cite wigmaker’s pages).
