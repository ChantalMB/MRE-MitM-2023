Indeed, these markings known formally as marginalia not only served a purpose to those who created them, they also serve a purpose for historians through how they may situate a text within its history and allow for a glimpse into the public and private lives of the annotator. Marginalia have been recognized as significant by scholars since as early as the 19th century, then used as a means to construct the history of earlier scholars in more detail and to expand upon their published works. Particularly of note from this time was literary scholar George Charles Moore Smith’s work. In 1913 he published a book that aimed to “illustrate the life, character, and opinions” of early modern writer Gabriel Harvey using his “unpublished materials”, citing Harvey’s vast array of marginalia in this process of extending existing knowledge.4 More current works tend to focus on the materiality of marginalia, using a combination of their content alongside their placement and material features of the book itself to analyze how early modern readers interacted with and used literature.5 One of the earlier modern seminal works in the history of reading, ““Studied for Action”: How Gabriel Harvey Read His Livy” by historians Lisa Jardine and Anthony Grafton, expand further on the notes produced by Gabriel Harvey to establish marginalia as an intellectual method through microscopic analysis of his annotations inserted into Livy’s ancient history of Rome.6 The article highlights Harvey’s active and purposeful approach to reading, characterized by his meticulous marginalia and extensive annotations. Through an analysis of Harvey’s notes and markings, Jardine and Grafton reveal how Harvey used Livy’s texts as a foundation for his own intellectual pursuits, employing them to shape his ideas, compositions, and refine his own writings.7 Harvey’s annotations not only offer insights into his personal interpretations of Livy’s works but also demonstrate his scholarly engagement and his desire to apply the lessons learned from ancient history to contemporary political and cultural contexts. By examining Harvey’s reading practices and the ways in which he interacted with Livy’s texts, the article sheds light on the active role of early modern scholars in constructing knowledge and engaging with classical literature for practical and intellectual purposes. Moving beyond the scholar, historian Heidi Brayman Hackel established the foundations of marginalia “as records of reading motivated by cultural, social, theological, and personal inclinations” through shifting the focus from professional scholars such as Harvey to the more casual reader.8 In this defining work on the history of reading, Reading Material in Early Modern England seeks to “delineate the asymmertries of early modern English literacies and reading habits and to expand the category of readers to include a greater variety of English people”; Brayman Hackel accompolishes this by offering a comprehensive examination the social, cultural, and intellectual contexts in which reading took place, providing insights into the reading practices of different members of society, including women, artisans, and the elite through the analysis of annotated texts in multiple formats.9 Through extensive research and select case studies ranging from the library of Lady Anne Clifford to unspecificed annotators present in copies of Philip Sidney’s Arcadia, Brayman Hackel delves into the materiality of texts, investigating the physical aspects of books and how they influenced reading experiences. She explores the use of illustrations, typography, and paratextual elements, demonstrating how these features shaped readers’ interactions with the texts. Through further investigation into print culture, the emergence of the printing press, and the significance of libraries, bookshops, and private collections in shaping access to and availability of reading materials, Brayman Hackel also addresses the impact of censorship and the control of reading materials by established institutions such as Oxford’s Bodleian Library and the authorities.10 By extension, Brayman Hackel also examines the purposes of reading in early modern England, ranging from religious and moral instruction to entertainment and leisure. Through this exploration, she counters the fiction of “a singular ideal reader ungrounded in place or time” and instead creates “a portrait of an early modern”gentle reader” alongside fragmentary glimpses of multiple readers at single moments in their reading lives.”11 Through emphasis on the importance of reading as a cultural and social practice and its impact on knowledge production, relationships, and the formation of early modern English society, Reading Material in Early Modern England contributes to our understanding of the broader historical and [cultural] significance of reading during this period, offering valuable insights into the ways in which texts were consumed, understood, and used in early modern English society. Closely following Brayman Hackel’s publication was the release of Used Books: Marking Readers in Renaissance England by William H. Sherman; Sherman’s work diverged from the case study model Brayman Hackel follows common in the history of reading, in that he chose to focus on collections of annotated books for his case studies rather than on individual readers or books. Through the isolated traces upon which his book rests, Sherman’s analyses yield “some larger patterns and a more systematic sense of how a wider group of readers used a wider range of books than in previous accounts of pre-modern marginalia.”12 By analyzing the marginalia of readers who left behind “substantial annotations”, Sherman uncovers the diverse motivations behind readers’ interactions with books, how these marks provide insights into the readers’ responses, interpretations, and both private and public connections with the text. Like Brayman Hackel, Sherman explores how these markings can reveal readers’ social identities, scholarly disciplines, and cultural values. However, unlike Brayman Hackel, Sherman focuses more of his analysis not only on content of the marginalia, but the materiality of the text which this marginalia is present in, “putting books alongside the other objects…to reconstruct the material, mental, and cultural worlds of our forebears.”13 Throughout the book, he pays close attention to “patterns of use” such as bindings, repairs, and other signs of wear, which offer further clues about the history of ownership, as well as early modern reading habits and the networks of exchange and circulation that facilitated the dissemination of ideas through books. Further, Sherman considered how the trade of “used” books functioned, the availability and affordability of texts, and the significance of book ownership in the cultural and intellectual life of the time, concluding that “Renaissance readers have much to teach us not only about the uses of books in the past but also about attitudes toward books where the past meets the present.”14 Uniting the work of marginalia as records of reading by Brayman Hackel and of material affordance by Sherman is Stephen Orgel, whose The Reader in the Book: A Study of Spaces and Traces examines individual acts of reading by examining books in which the text and marginalia are “in intense communication with each other, glossing, correcting, reminding, emphasizing, arguing — cases in which reading constitutes an active and sometimes adversarial engagement with the book.”15 However, in tandem with this Orgel focuses more intensely on the book’s materiality than Brayman Hackel, here echoing Sherman’s work, exploring the physical and conceptual spaces created within books and the traces left there by readers, offering an analysis of how reading practices have evolved across the early modern period. Drawing both upon works that are considered early modern literary classics in the present as well as books that were considered classics in their own time, Orgel delves into the ways in which readers absorb the texts they annotate; the concept of reading as writing. He explores the physicality of books, including their size, format, and design, and how these factors shape the reading and by extension annotating experience. Like Brayman Hackel, The Reader in the Book delves into the social and cultural aspects of reading, examining how readers’ identities, backgrounds, and personal experiences influence their engagement with literature. Each chapter of Orgel’s work considers factors such as gender, class, and education, highlighting the diverse ways in which readers approach and unravelled texts. He joins the discussion of materiality and content through understanding how the book itself was conceptualised during the early modern period; how in the shift from manuscript to print culture, the book became not simply a text, but a place and property, and by extension of this, how the goal of printing was not exact replication of an original text but dissemination.16 Woven throughout Orgel’s book is also a timeline of the historical evolution of reading practices, from manuscript culture to the advent of printing and the digital age. Orgel ultimately offers comprehensive analysis of how changes in reading technologies and the dissemination of texts have shaped the book and reader’s role over time. Although not explicitly dealing with the study of marginalia as previously mentioned works have Juliet Fleming’s work on material affordances particular to the book and the pen, packaged in her comprehensive book Cultural Graphology: Writing after Derrida, is considered key in understanding the annotation of texts as not just acts of reading, but as writing “which is material, which has the power to invent things (including selves), and which exists at the intersection of generic norms and technological affordances.”17 As the title of her book indicates, Fleming accomplishes this by expanding on the notion of “cultural graphology” that Jacques Derrida loosely proposes in his work, Grammatology, which examines the relationship between writing practices, materiality, and cultural contexts. Fleming engages with Derrida’s deconstructionist approach and expands upon his ideas to analyze the ways in which writing functions as a cultural and social practice through the lens of the writing culture in early modern England, particularly as it came to be influenced by the commercial development of print.18 She investigates the materiality of writing, including handwriting, typography, and inscriptions, to [unveil the hidden meanings and cultural significance embedded within written texts]. By examining the dynamics of writing within cultural contexts, Fleming challenges the idea that writing is a neutral tool for communication. She explores how writing practices are shaped by cultural and historical factors, emphasizing the multiplicity of meanings and interpretations that emerge from written texts. Especially relevant to the discussion of marginalia is Fleming’s conceptualization of the “renaissance collage” which describes the reading undertaken in this period with scissors and knives, through the cutting of the page and associated processes of sewing, stitching, gluing, and filing.19 She categorises the act of cutting books with reasons such as “to remove proscribed or offensive material from prayer books and primers, to obviate the labor of copying in producing commonplace books and other compilations, to reformat texts in order to rationalize the material they contained, to provide room for marginal or other commentaries, to add other material to and thereby expand a given text, to organize their own researches, and to illustrate or embellish presentation and other manuscripts with motifs cut from printed sources,” thus establishing this form of readers’ traces not as not just the organization of written information, but also as an act of writing. For Fleming, “the cut opens, gathers and sorts; it shapes the present and introduces the future” akin to how historians of reading posit marginalia is used; cutting is not destructive, but rather a means to grow the work being interacted with. Through her exploration of cultural graphology, Fleming invites readers, and in particular, historians of reading and the book, to critically engage with the complexities of writing as a cultural practice. She highlights the significance of materiality, historical context, and philosophical underpinnings in understanding the role of writing in shaping and reflecting cultural and social dynamics.

Before discussing the presence of marginalia within the archive, it is important to understand how marginalia itself is defined. In the broadest sense of the word, marginalia encompasses anything left in the periphrals of a text, with the word deriving from the Latin margō (“border, edge”) which evolved into the Medieval Latin neuter plural of marginālis (“on the periphery”).20 However, those who study marginlia typically seek to shape the meaning of it further, within the context of their own and others’ research. In her 1994 analysis of annotations present in copies of Caxton’s Royal Book, Elaine E. Whitaker proposed that marginalia tended to fall into the following three categories: [TO DO: fix formatting] Editing Censorship Affirmation Interaction A. Devotional Use B. Social Critique Avoidance A. Doodling B. Daydreaming21 Providing further context to these categories, she noted that readers would edit their texts by covering sections (A) or emphasising sections with a varitey of both standard and idiosyncratic marks (B). Whitaker defines interaction with the text by the reader accepting a passage and noting how it applies to their own lives (A), or appropriating it as a critique of someone or something else (B). She then outlines avoidance as being a subversive act, in which the reader used their text for something like the practice of penmanship (A) or recording thoughts that are not relevant to the text (B).22 In a similar vein, Carl James Grindley in his analysis of late medieval and early modern copies of Piers Plowman put forward the following classifications for printed and written marginalia in texts: TYPE I, which comprises marginalia that are without any identifiable context; TYPE II, which comprises marginalia that exist within a context associated with that of the manuscript itself; and TYPE III, which comprises marginalia directly associated with the various texts that the manuscript contains.23 Grindley greatly expands on these classifications with specific sub-types assigned to each [class]. Type I includes marginalia such as doodles or sample texts– “short works, in either poetry or prose, which were added in an unplanned if not haphazard manner to a non-related existing text”– similar to Whitaker’s category of “Avoidance”.24 Type II marginalia encompasses the space between marginalia unrelated to the text it uses as its foundation and that which [reveals the “active” reader]. While not providing explicit commentary on the text at hand, this form of marginalia might offer introductory materials such as brief descriptive notes identifying the main theme or subject of a work, or marks of attribution that indicate the origin of a text. Type III marginalia tend to be the form of marginalia which historians such as Sherman and Orgel anchor their [textual analysis to]; this marginalia is substantial and “implies a coherent reader response to a particular text” which in turn elicits the most substantial sub-classification by Grindley. He breaks down Type III marginalia into the following: Narrative Reading Aids, which denote annotations that include aids to understanding the narrative present in the text, such as citations, translations, or summation. Ethical Pointers are a demonstration of ethical positionality. Polemical Reponses are associated with a social or political issue in the text, either deliberating over the situation at hand or applying the situation to one that is contemporary with the commentator. Literary Responses entail the reader engaging in diaglogue with the text, through commenting on linguistic, humorous, ironical, allegorical, metaphorical, or other “poetic” elements of the text. Graphical Responses feature systemised forms of graphic shorthand or added punctuation. With [breakdown] of classification, Grindley sought to aid the historian in answering the questions of what a particular reader was interested in, how the reader organize a text, what reactions readers had to particular passages, and if the annotations followed any general themes.25 In the three categories which Brayman Hackel outlines in her survey of English readers, she seemingly only considers Grindley’s Type III classification as being “marginalia”: Early modern readers’ handwritten marks in books generally fall into three classes, each of which exposes a set of attitudes about books and reading. Marks of active reading (deictics, underlining, summaries, cross-references, queries), to which I refer loosely as marginalia, suggest that the book is to be engaged, digested, and re-read. Marks of ownership (signatures, shelf marks, proprietary verses) distinguish a book as a physical object, to be protected, catalogued, inventoried, and valued. Marks of recording (debts, marriages, births, accounts) seem to reside somewhere in between: like ownership marks, they suggest that the book has physical value; like readers’ marks, they convey that the book is a site of information. For each of these three kinds of notes, the book takes on a different role: as intellectual process, as valued object, and as available paper. For Brayman Hackel, “active” reading and evidence of intellectual process appear to be prerequisites to a mark being classified as “marginalia”. Unlike previous systems of classification and as Orgel [points out], Brayman Hackel also does not leave space in her classifications for the ubiquitous “irrelevant markings” despite discussing these findings in her analysis of copies of Arcadia26: Fragments of verse, lists of clothing, enigmatic phrases, incomplete calculations, sassy records of ownership: some of these traces merely puzzle. Drawings and doodlings in other copies hint at other associations or preoccupations: a shield painted in watercolors, impish faces peering out from the margin, geometric figures on a flyleaf, a mother and child on a blank sheet. Pens are not the only objects that have left impressions in these books; pressed flowers survive in two volumes, and the rust outlines of pairs of scissors betray the forgetfulness of the binders, presumably, of two other copies. But other marks do fall into larger patterns, joining hands across several volumes. Fifty-six percent of the books carry marginalia or scribbling on flyleaves, most commonly in the form of penmanship practice, emendations, underlinings, and finding notes.27 [What is and is not classified as marginalia outlines a framework– both one theorised to be that of the composers, and one that the historian may follow when analysising their marks]. These marks that Brayman Hackel excluded from her framework of marginalia have been conceptualized by other scholars as “graffiti”; Jason Scott-Warren draws upon Fleming’s work in considering the material affordance of that which has been marked– [these impromptu inscriptions are ones which emphasize the availability and visibility of the writing surface.] Fundamentally, “graffiti” is evocative of the person who created it, the place they put it, and the documentation of a relationship between them.28 One of the most common forms of graffiti found in early modern books is “sassy records of ownership” as Brayman Hackel calls it, the recording of names, present not in a conventional sense of simply marking ownership of the text at hand, but strewn throughout the text, written repeatedly, in a way similar to how a graffiti artist may tag buildings throught their city. For example, in a copy of the chapbook The Letter Writer held in the National Library of Scotland’s archive, annotator John Watson appeared to have used the pages to practice his signature, marking a number of pages with his name in both cursive and print. Figure 3.1: https://digital.nls.uk/chapbooks-printed-in-scotland/archive/104186662#?c=0&amp;m=0&amp;s=0&amp;cv=0&amp;xywh=-845%2C0%2C3009%2C2231 Sherman expands on the value of these markings well; in studying the annotated texts found in the Huntington Library, he noted how a majoority of the annotations had no obvious connection with the text they accompanied, yet they “nonetheless testiﬁed to the place of that book in the reader’s social life, family history, professional practices, political commitments, and devotional rituals.”29 The archives which I draw from for this project’s case study will be expanded upon much more extensively [in a later section], yet at this moment it is valuable to consider how marginalia is represented in them; what is counted as marginalia? The Archaeology of Reading (AoR) collection existed as a project to digitize and compile select annotated books from the libraries of prolific early modern readers John Dee and Gabriel Harvey, and to then [transcribe], and occasionally translate, the marginalia on pages it is present so that it can be easily read alongside the printed text and archival item’s metadata.30 In studying these transcriptions, AoR includes any category of textual marginalia of which there is plenty due to the interactive approach Dee and Harvey took to reading. The more elaborate graphical responses such as manicules and florilegia are also made note of, however symbols such as small crosses or underlinings are excluded despite (or perhaps because of) their abundance. [These symbols are often excluded from broad analysis of marginalia despite being a constant presence found almost exclusively in the margins of text– they are marginalia in the truest sense of the word.] Conversely, the Early Modern Annotated Books collection from UCLA’s William Andrews Clark Memorial Library only identified that the book, or, collection of pages, had marginalia within them, but did not indicate which pages and by extension, any transcription of the marginalia. What is defined as marginalia is entirely up to the reader of their archive. 3.2.2 Physical and Digital Presence In considering the archive, marginalia have always been present yet their presence has always been contencious. Early modern readers were taught to read with tool to write in hand; they were not just encouraged to annotate their books, but taught how to do so in their schooling.31 Marginalia was a way for readers to connect with their previous knowledge, literature, and each other as the book circulated, yet as the concern exists at present, there was concern even during the early modern period about, as Sherman phrases it, “dirty books”. Books with marginalia were considered marred, being no longer in the pristine condition that they were in [fresh off the printing press], which was a largely desired state for collectors from the early modern period into the 20ht century.32 The notable exception to this rule being annotations made by famous figures such as William Shakespeare or Francis Bacon, which added value to the books, that is, if they were identified before being “cleaned”. Due to the desire for [virigin] books, annotated books were often “restored” in a way that removed the marginalia present through methods such as the bleaching of page edges or by cutting out the margins of these books then rebinding them. This is all to say, the marginalia present in physical archives around the world is either skewed to portraying to the reading and writing practices of a select educated and [famed] class of society, perserved due to the perceived significance of the books they owned, or accidental byproducts of archiving [used books]. This historical lack of intentional [curation] of marginalia has made the exploration of them a challenge; there are no single physical archives that gather marginalia en masse to be studied, they are more often discovered organically when studying the content of early modern books, or by paging through large collections of early modern books with the intention of searching for marginalia specifically. Since marginalia is laregly left uncatalogued, it remains difficult to find even during the advent of the digital archive. In 2008, reflecting on the labourious process he undertook when producing his expansive text on early modern marginalia, Sherman wrote in the afterword of Used Books: Databases and facsimiles of the sort described above are primarily concerned with giving us access to accurate and attractive informational content and with helping us to make our way around it (a goal generally known, in the computer and information sciences, as “usability”). Their emphasis on “interactivity” notwithstanding, they have not yet imagined us doing much with or to books beyond turning their pages and have not yet found ways to preserve our marks—much less to improve them or to educate us about the markings of those who turned pages before us.33 As of the year I am writing this, 2023, despite many technological advances in the realm of [web design and graphical displays], Sherman’s statement holds largely true. AoR is the only project I discovered in the process of research that places marginalia in the context of “those who turned pages before us,” yet its functionalailty does not go beyond turning from page to page, and simple manipulations such as zooming in and out. There are very few archival projects in book history that go beyond these simple manipulations, although coincedentally, the one project I did come across in which 3D models were constructed from the pages of manuscripts found at Lichfield Cathedral had margnialia make an accidental appearence.[https://lichfield.ou.edu/file/14428] As a whole, marginalia is still not easily discoverable even with digitized archives outside of projects dedicated to identifying marginalia, which are also few. Certainly, this is in large part due to metadata standards which shape digital archival items failing to adapt their form to the unique affordances that digitization offers; metadata standards for digitization focus on documenting details about the physical object and were developed from the same catalouging standards that exculded marginalia originally. AoR explains this problem as one they faced during the development of their project. Upon digitizing the books of Dee and Harvey, they then needed to select a standard to use when creating the digital documents. Initially, they looked at the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) standard, formed by a consortium which collectively develops and maintains a standard for the representation of texts in digital form; the TEI is largely considerd a high standard of documentation for representing digitized texts, yet upon further investigation AoR found that TEI left no option for recording annotations featured on a text, thus they ultimately had to create their own bespoke digitzation schema for their project which centered around this form of text. As I will demonstrate, there are now computational methods that could be used by archives to discover marginalia in their collections and in turn, an opportunity to automatically enhance their metadata. However, these methods require an extensive amount of “examples” of marginalia in order to begin identifying it; these examples are difficult to accumulate due to the lack of any indication of marginalia within digital archives, thus creating a cycle in which marginalia continues to be an elusive presence. 3.3 On Object Marks and Machines (Note: I think this discussion is valuable and makes for a good concluding remark, but it does feel sort if random?) Acheson’s book raises a number of historical, cultural, and theoretical questions about books and their readers, many of which could be explored further through greater access to more obscure, both literally and figuratively, research materials such as marginalia. Adam Smyth’s contribution to Early Modern English Marginalia particularly emphasises this; in his chapter, he sought to identify current traits in recent works on the history of marginalia which bring to the surface a number of questions, paradoxes or gaps, through the analysis of object traces in early modern books.34 These traits-as-problems which Smyth uses to illustrate the value of attending to object traces can also be used to understand the value of integrating machine learning methods, particularly object detection, into the study of marginalia. The history of reading has often revolved around individual readers, even as early modern studies broadly have shifted away from this and towards to the coterie, and, in more recent years, to the network as the unit of cultural analysis.35 This focus on biography has meant that studies of marginalia have tended to connect book annotations back to the individual who created them at the expense of other ways of organizing marginalia, such as by genre. Further expanding on the neglect of genre, the use of biography as the frame for analysing marginalia books has meant that scholars, preoccupied connecting the page marks to the reader’s life and identity, have spent less time seeking to establish fundamental histories of the marks themselves, such as where the conventions for marking books came from; in seeking to link marginalia to writing outside of the host text, Smyth posits the questions, “What category of mark or intervention are they? What is the larger group in which they belong?”36 The tether which holds the study of marginalia to biography is at least in part due to the issues of discoverability that marginalia presents. Although more reliably discoverable than the trace object marks which Smyth features in his work, marginalia still demands time to be found whether the host being searched is physical or digital. Finding genre or larger categories which marginalia can be viewed through or belong to require wide reading of numerous sources in order to be defined. Undoubtly, the work of studying and defining marginalia [to date] has been an impressive feat, but as noted by the historians who performed this feat, it The automated detection of marginalia allows for large and diverse corpori to be evaluated for the presence of marginalia with little supervision and more efficiently than a researcher is able to sift through these works manually; following this quick process of identifying marginalia, researchers may then focus on the discovery of genre through analysis of the object detector’s output. Another trait Smyth identifies in the study of marginalia is the assignment of the reader as “active”. Rather than being “passive”, readers read with an idea of practical application in their world and the future, “reading as intended to give rise to something else.”37 Smyth refers to the inverse of an active reader, an inactive reader, as being found present in unmarked pages, yet I propose an inactive reader could also be defined as one who dismisses the content of the book in favour of its materiality, as something that can be repurposed as a diary or catalogue of debts (cite wigmaker’s pages). It is this genre of “inactive” reading that I attempt to find in the following case study using an object detection model applied to the NLS collection of early modern chapbooks printed in Scotland.38 By macroscopely analysing the marginalia of over 3000 works made for popular consumption, trends in how these booklets were used as something more than just the entertainment found in their contents can be identified.

Research which makes use of these digital objects often fails to account for the sources, technologies, and social realities of the objects’ creation in ways that make their affordances and limitations more readily visible and available for critique.3940 Likewise, in conceptualizing digital archives as sources of data in their book, Data Feminism, Catherine D’Ignazio and Laura Klein discuss data science and ethics as informed by intersectional feminism; they continuously emphasize the necessity of further context at all stages of working with “data”, from acquisition to analysis, because the context which data is situated in is seen as essential to the ultimate “framing and communication of results” formed through its use.41 When archival materials are integrated into research utilizing more traditional methods of historical inquiry, the subject being analyzed tends to be singular, which in turn makes answering these questions manageable without extensive organization, since there is cohesion across sources. Comparatively, the large amount of data needed for machine learning tasks often results in these questions being difficult to answer on a microscopic level, because the metadata for each archival item used is omitted during the process of data collection. The scale of the dataset produced makes such detailed information be perceived as unnecessary. Yet these details which go into the first step of building a machine learning model are vital to understanding the influences and limitations of it; the foundations which machines learn with and from are human, meaning that they contain “human subjectivities, biases, and distortions” like all other works created by humans.42 In order to produce meaningful output using either analog or automated research methods such as machine learning for identification, it is vital to interrogate the input that contributed to the making of the method being applied for answers regarding social, cultural, historical, institutional, and material conditions under which that input was produced, as well as about the identities of the people who created it.43 These discussions on metadata’s presence within both digital archives and the process of machine learning are what framed the first technical component of my MRE, a further adaptation of an application I created for the International Space Station Archaeology Project (ISSAP) to support the needs of archeologists working on the project.44 The ISSAP version of the application is used to analyze photos taken of the living quarters ISSAP received from the International Space Station. The project sought to understand how astronauts use the space of the habitation modules by tracking the small items of daily use across the station as they appeared and disappeared in photographs.45 The tool I created for ISSAP is a rewritten version of the more general purpose Visual Geometry Group Image Annotator developed at Oxford University; the original tool was not suitable for the project because it could not be used collaboratively and did not have a structure for the automated recording of metadata as annotations are generated.46 In general, image annotators are used when creating applications for computer vision to create datasets for the purpose of training classification or detection [based] machine learning models to recognize items of interest. The researcher annotates the image, and the machine learning model learns to look for these features which have been marked as important. A side effect of this approach is that the metadata created by the researcher while producing these annotations to train the model with becomes divorced from the original metadata of the images. When considering this in relation to the study of book marginalia, it is equivalent to cutting the marginalia out of the pages and only analyzing those select segments without any thought about the document the marginalia came from. I sought to expand on the collaboration functionality as well as the ability to import existing metadata from both the archive and directly from the images to be annotated. With this feature, new metadata can be produced alongside the context of the original object metadata common in archives, allowing for the tool to become not only an image annotator, but also a way to reference and track the creation of training data for machine learning projects. Additionally, all metadata will be searchable, allow for researchers to easily reference specific data points and for scholars to browse the data which formed the output being presented to them. 4.1 Technical Overview [Before delving into the details of its creation, it is important to briefly consider the technical foundation of the application, not only for the purposes of transparency and reproducabilty, but also to understand the very first considerations that went into how the end product took form.] The code for this application was written using SvelteKit, a framework for building web applications using a specialised implementation of JavaScript.[https://kit.svelte.dev/] When the website is compiled, the step in the web development process where the code is converted into what is displayed on a web page, the code is converted into highly efficient vanilla JavaScript resulting in faster performance [compared to traditional frameworks that compile into multifaceted layers]. It is this performance advantage, as well as easy of use, that led me to select SvelteKit for this task, since as an image annotator, users would be uploading and interacting with with files, as well as [populating files with data] which can be computationally heavy tasks, thus having a performant framework was a must. To transform the SvelteKit web application into a desktop application, I used Electron, an open-source software framework that allows developers to build cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Electron powers many popular desktop applications such as Discord, Slack, Notion, and even the application which I am writing in right now, Visual Studio Code. [It functions by running the web application code using a Chromium browser engine, essentially turning the code into a browser itself designed to do the singular task which the web application’s code instructs it to do.] Due to its popularity, Electron has extensive documentation and a large community making it a good choice for developers such as myself who have little experience creating desktop-based software. The most significant limitation Electron presents is that by using web technologies to build desktop applications, there can be a slightly higher memory consumption and application size compared to “native” applications, which are software that is developed specifically for a particular operating system or platform and thus very able to be more optimized [since they are developed with very specific hardware parameters in mind]. Alternatives to Electron which focus on reducing memory consumption and application size have begun to be developed in recent years, the most notable being Tauri, however they optimize the application through using whatever browser engine the operating system comes pre-installed with rather than installing a dedicated one; for example, if a user is opening the application on an Apple device, it will run using a Safari browser engine. Each browser has different development standards and ways which they display information, so if the application uses the browser engine based on the user’s device, the developer ultimately has little control over how the application appears and functions outside of the operating system that they use to develop the application, unless they have access to multiple machines to perform testing, as well as the resources to tailor a version of the application to each browser engine. I chose to make my application a desktop tool rather than publish it as a website to ensure both ease of collaboration and use. The application functions by creating and updating a project save file, which is simply a JSON file that contains all data surrounding the images selected for annotation, as well as any annotations drawn upon each image. JSON files are human readable, common and thus have many tools that make them useable even outside of the application, and small in size which makes them easily shareable. When used in a project with collaborative annotation needs, the project save file can be placed in a shared code repository such as GitHub and versions can be managed using Git. This method also adds a level to transparency to a project using my application, as each step of annotating images and changes are being recorded through each push to the repository, assuming the repository is public. As a security measure, web browsers are not allowed access to a user’s file system; when uploading a file to a website, a temporary [fake] path to the selected file is generated, and this is either used to make a copy of the file which is then stored on the website’s server (for example, Google Drive), or temporarily stored then discarded once the web page is closed, the latter of these options being very resource intensive if uploading a large number of files. Electron applications allow access to the file system, since although it makes use of a browser engine, this engine is installed and run locally on the user’s device rather than being connected to the World Wide Web. When starting a new or existing project with my application, the user is first prompted to select the folder of images which they want to annotate. This establishes a path to where the images are on the user’s computer since this does not get saved in the project save file, as paths to where the images are located are unique to each device. If the user wants to open an existing project, they will also be prompted to select the project save JSON file. The path to this file will also be saved so that when the user manually saves their project, this same file will be updated. Access to the file system also allows for the application to autosave the project save file, so should anything go wrong, the user will lose at most ten minutes of work. In summary, Electron ensures that the functional, visual, and file-based user experience is universal when using this tool. 4.2 Process 4.2.1 Interface and Tooling As a whole, when designing the interface of my application, I sent through the design around the user experience/design concepts of mapping, and the principle of familiarity. The principle of familiarity is concerned with the ability of an interactive system to allow a user to map prior experiences, either real world or gained from interaction with other systems, onto the features of a new system. By extension, mapping in this context is using a familiar imagery to invoke the action/operation which an interactive element will perform. The layout of the app is similar to other popular tools for image manipulation, such as those within the Adobe Suite, MS Paint, or Windows Photo Viewer. [screenshot comparing app to PS] To the left of the window is a simple tool bar, which allows user to select the shape they want to use for annotating the image (set to a rectangle by default), perform basic manipulations like zooming in and out in a controlled manner, and “reset” the image to its original position. This tool bar is hovering over the largest component of the application, the image viewer and annotation canvas. This viewer utilizes technology that those in the humanities are likely already familiar with, [even if they might not be aware of it]. The image viewer itself uses OpenSeadragon, a tool for viewing high-resolution zoomable images, which is the technology largely behind image viewers used by digital archives. aside from using the tool bar’s buttons, OpenSeadragon also allows user to manipulate the image using trackpad gestures as well as click-and-drag to move around the image. Annotorious works with OpenSeadragon to allow for annotations to be drawn on images viewed in the OpenSeadragon window; this combination has been leveraged for cultural heritage purposes [before], one notable example being the Arts and Humanities Research Council crowdsourcing platform, MicroPasts, which allows for the public to assist with [large scale] archaeology, history and heritage tasks.[https://crowdsourced.micropasts.org/] At the bottom right of the image viewer are arrows the user may use to switch from one image to the next, however they may also do so by using the left and right arrow keys. Occupying the right side of the application window is the [primary space for file management]. At the top of this space, users can either return to the home menu should they want to begin a new project, choose to manually save their project, or select where they want the project save file to be saved. Below this is a file viewer, where users can add images they want to annotate from the image folder they selected when creating the project or remove them, as well as view a list of image files they have uploaded. The user can also jump to any of the images by clicking the relevant file name in the file list. Below the file list is a drop down menu where the user may apply a filter that indicates whether images have or have not been annotated, which functions by highlighting the entry in the file list that matches the filter criteria. The search bar functions in the same highlighting manner, except it highlights the images which have metadata that matches the search term. Following this, there is an “Export” menu in which users can choose to export their annotated images [into a variety of popular data formats] used for training object detection models. The last section included in this [side bar] is a quick guide to how the application functions as a reminder to users who have just begun using the application or are returning to the project after a period time away from it. 4.2.2 Annotation and Metadata [screenshot showing anno/metadata viewer] The most [academically driven] component of this application is the annotation editor and metadata viewer which occupies most of the application’s bottom pane. [At the surface level], it is designed to appear similar to a spread sheet such as those found in Excel, so it is intuitive to the user understanding what the section of the application is for and how it is used. In the first tab, “Annotations”, there are five descriptive columns present [automatically]: the annotation’s unique ID, the date and time the annotation is created, who the annotation is created by, the broader category the annotations falls into, and what specifically the annotation is. There is a “+” symbol at the end of the column headers that allows the user extend this metadata through adding their own columns specific to the project. A row is added to this table each time an annotation is drawn on an image, and likewise, deleting an annotation on the image canvas deletes the corresponding row, facilitating a direct [connection] between the image and the metadata being generated. The second tab, “Metadata”, displays data associated with the image being annotated– this can be metadata from the digital archive which the image was obtained from if the archive chooses to tag their images with this information or the user does so in the process of collecting the images, as well as any additional EXIF data that can be extracted from the image. Returning to Cordell’s work, he encourages [us] to think of items found within digital archives as not simply a transparent surrogate for a corresponding physical object, but instead as a “new edition” in the full bibliographic sense of the word; while it “departs more and more from the form impressed upon it by its original author,” it nonetheless “exerts, through its imperfections as much as through its perfections, its own influence upon its surroundings.”47 When it comes to cultural heritage collections, the digtised item is often described in metadata as if it were the original item picture rather than a new version; [in museums, replicas of detoriated artefacts are marked as such, yet digitized objects are often treated as if they are exact subsitutes for the physical.] As Adam Crymble demonstrates in his history of mass digitization, the digitization of primary sources was to a great extent driven by the desire to democratize primary sources for education and research purposes; in the beginning, digitised sources were explicitly intended to be surrogates for the original.48 By and large, digitized sources have been used as such, and so this form of metadata has been considered suitable for its audience. Yet in the age of big data and machine learning, the digitial archive’s audience has shifted from solely human consumption to machine consumption as well, and [archival metadata and what that entails] must be expanded to fit this use. [Metadata, the data which describes data, is what holds data accountable.] In [the context of machine learning], what has been perceived as valuble is the data that will be used to train a model, and any data surrounding that data is largely ignored or discarded after it is finished its use in create the training data. A model uses an algorithim to make sense of the data given to it, and produce some form of task or output, such as classifying images or generating a paragraph of text. In order for an algorithim to adquately “learn” to do something, it needs an extensive number of examples; for example, the Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset is a popular dataset used for training object detection models, and it contains 1.5 million examples of objects in photos which fall into one of 80 categories.[https://cocodataset.org/#home] It is thought that with such expansive datasets, what purpose would such [microscopic] information serve when the data is [not created by nor possible to be revised in its entirety by a person]? This line of thought has resulted in researchers lacking an understanding of the training data being used to train their models, which has led to multiple instances of machines learning to replicate the harmful views their creators possess. [give example of this]. In recent years, there has been movement within the field of computer science towards critical analysis of how datasets are constructed, composed, and used. Primarily, these efforts have been directed toward standardizing the documentation of datasets through “datasheets”, overviews attached to datasets which communicate the content of a dataset in a way that prioritizes transparency and accountability.49 Within this conversation, there has been encouragement to draw upon the existing language and procedures for managing sociocultural data within libraries and archives. In Lessons from Archives, scholars Eun Seo Jo and Timnit Gebru argue that archives, as “a form of large-scale, collective human record-keeping”, can aid in addressing the questions of power imbalance, privacy, and other ethical concerns that datasheets leave unaddressed [through interventionist data collection strategies to address biases and ensure fair representation].50 They indicate a number of ways they believe practices which emerge from archival studies would enhance the practice of machine learning; firstly, that archives begin with focused, institutional mission statements that outline a commitment to “collecting the cultural remains of certain concepts, topics, or demographic groups” which guides their data collection process, as well as curators who are responsible for weighing the risks and benefits of gathering different types of data in relation to an archive’s objectives and have developed theoretical frameworks for appraising collected data.51 Gebru and Jo encourage the machine learning community to approach data collection and appraisal by at least starting with a statement of commitment rather than starting with datasets by availability to ensure equitable targets during the construction of datasets. Further, archives often have codes of conduct or ethics and a professional framework for enforcing them alongside developed detailed standards for data description, ensuring ethical practices in data collection by helping ensure transparency and accountability; these multi-faceted forms of review and record-keeping are unheard of in machine learning data collection.52 Lastly, archival sciences have promoted collective efforts to address issues of representation, inclusivity, and power imbalance; for example, community-based activism has been used to ensure that various cultures are represented in the manner in which they would like to be seen.53 Machine learning researchers can draw from these efforts towards participatory archives to ensure diverse and inclusive datasets. As Lessons from Archives highlights, the issues of [historical power structures and how they may now be undone] have long been discussed within archival studies. Yet what Lessons from Archives does not discuss is the digital turn within the archive itself, how the archive, through embracing a digital form, has moved from being a [collective of human recordkeeping] to a collection of data to be made sense of and mined.54 When viewing collections themselves as data, archival data is seen as beneficial for the existing metadata associated with/describing each archival item; unlike a blog post where metadata about it needs to be constructed by identifying and compiling available information from the web page, items in a collection have this descriptive information already curated and compiled. Yet a significant issues comes from this perception of digtial archives broadly as [complete] in their current state. Despite instituational mission statements, codes of ethics, and community contributions, at an individual item level, the metadata is still the same as that in catalogs which have long represented groups of people in problematic ways. What has changed is the new methodology being used to promote the use and reuse of these descriptions and collections. As librarian Sophie Ziegler writes in their article Open Data in Cultural Heritage Institutions: Can We Be Better Than Data Brokers?, “The collections as data framework in cultural institutions carries with it the possibility for our descriptions of people to be shared, combined with other data, and used to negatively affect groups.”55 When framing the archive as data, there is a risk that the archival holdings and their descriptions will look objective and natural, and the work of archivists and others to show how archival collections are never neutral and natural will be obscured; Devon Mordell encourages “active participation and critical discourse” around the tools and practices to ensure that new technologies reinscribe this false sense of neutrality.5657 One simple yet significant action that works toward this goal is incorporating data process and provenance into the standardized documentation practices for collections. During his time as Humanities Data Curator at the University of California Santa Barbara, Thomas Padilla emphasized the concept of legibility within metadata, that to make collections as data usable, the processes behind their establishment must be transparent and documented. In the context of libraries, Padilla indicates that: Libraries do not often provide access to the scripts that generate collection derivatives, access to processes for cleaning or subsetting data, access to custom schema that have been used, indications of how representative digital holdings are relative to overall holdings, nor is the quality of data typically indicated. Libraries do not typically expose why some collections have been made available and others have not. Libraries do not typically identify the library staff personally responsible for modifying, describing, and creating collections – a dimension of provenance that must be accessed in order to determine data ability to support a research claim.58 These same claims can be applied to archival items. Without this information, the user’s ability to comprehend and thus utilize a collections as data is hindered which leaves the data vulnerable to misuse. The potential of collections as data hinges on integrity validated through expanded documentation practice. The annotation editor and metadata viewer within my application seeks to address the digital archive in the state it is at present, where the level at which data provenance is addressed varies widely from institution to institution, in a practical manner. The metadata viewer shows both how the image was contextualise within the archive it was extracted from, and since many archives have not yet [started] to include information about the entry as a digital object, the application includes the automatic extraction of EXIF data from the image to expand the predefined archival metadata. EXIF data is the metadata embedded within digital images, and it can provide details on camera settings including make and model, date and time the image was captured, geographic information regarding where an image was taken, photography settings such as white balance or flash usage, and information on what software was used to process or edit the image. Essentially, a potentially detailed history of how an image was captured and processed when this information might not otherwise be present. Being able to view both the archival and digital metadata in the process of annotation ultimately aides in circumventing the decontextualized access and consumption which occurs during the process of annotating data for computational research.59 In [light of discussion over digitized archival objects being a new edition in the lineage of an item], the annotation editor expands on this mode of thought and encourages the annotator to view their annotations in the same way. Each annotation visually segments a portion of the image from its surroundings, marking it as something significant which is important enough to be highlighted and thus it should be documented in a way that is similar to other digital objects. One way [humanists can distinguish themselves] in the process of creating datasets with the end goal of machine learning is through the addition of explanations about decisions that we make while creating data.60 While the ability to add their own columns in this tab encourage the user to create structured metadata for their annotations, even without adding additional columns, the user still must record who created the annotation and basic descriptive information about the contents of the annotation, capturing key metadata which holds the creator of it accountable in the process of creation for each annotation. Treating annotations as new digital objects both enhances familiarity with the training data and constructs a more robust log of the training data with more findable items should an issue arise during the process of or after training a model.

Added in to this set of images was 20 [negative examples], that is, pages which contain no marginalia. Another advantage of the YOLO algorithim is that there is typically little need for negative examples; in the intial step of dividing the inputted image into a grid then [analyzing] each segment, the model will naturally learn how to identify “no object” since a majority of images will not contain objects in every grid segment. However, when the images being used to train the model are “busy” with the objects being detected possibly being present across the entire page, such as with images of traffic or in our case, with pages of text and profilic annotation, training results can be improved through the intentional addition of negative examples to reduce false positives caused by heavy overlap of desired objects and [background] objects. This set of images was then randomly split using the standard 80/20 training/test ratio, with 298 (~80%) images being used to train the model, 37 (~10%) images being used to validate the model while it trains, and 38 (~10%) images to test the results of the trained model. YOLOv7 recommends 1500 images per new class, so to give this small dataset a fighting chance at successfully detecting marginalia, I applied various transformations to the original training images to create augmented versions of this data. These transformations modified the images in ways that preserve their essential features but introduce variation that can enhance the model’s ability to generalize. Not only does data augmentation increase the amount of training data by by generating multiple versions of each original image, but also by presenting the model with different variations of the same image (e.g., different rotations, flips, translations, zoom levels, etc.), data augmentation helps the model learn to recognize important patterns and features that are invariant to those transformations. At the same time, it also helps prevent the model from memorizing specific details of the training data which results in “overfitting”– [we] want a model that detects meaningful and relevant features rather than memorizing specific examples. In the context of this case study, each of the 298 training images were augmented through added noise, added gaussian blur, randomly changed contrast, randomly changed brightness, and randomly changed saturation. This expanded the total training image set to 1788 (298*6). The following sections will be shaped by Benjamin Charles Germain Lee’s recently proposed framework for using collections as machine learning data.61 My dataset for this case study was created using three digital archives, ranging from those being made intentionally friendly to computational use to ones following the [standard] archival model, each of which thus emboding the current conversations being had about digital archives as big data. The cultural heritage collection as data Here, a distinction is drawn between the cultural heritage collection being studied and the training dataset being utilized for the machine learning model. For example, a project might utilize a pre-trained model to generate embeddings for a photo collection. In this section, we consider the cultural heritage collection itself; in the section “The Machine Learning Model,” we consider the machine learning model’s training data. Dataset composition: Who or what is depicted in the dataset? (Gebru et al., 2020) - The dataset is composed of annotated pages from three digital archives. - Initially spurring this project was a small selection of annotated pages from the National Library of Scotland’s collection of chapbooks which I had made note of when they were erranously detected as illustrations, during previous work in which I attempted to classify pages in the corpus that contained illustrations. Since the ultimate goal for this case study is to intentionlly identify marginalia in this collection of chapbooks, I chose to incorporate these pages into the training data for both diversity and to provide domain specific examples in hopes of improving the trained model’s performance. - The Archaeology of Reading project which was a collaborative effort between the Sheridan Libraries, Centre for Editing Lives and Letters, and Princeton University library that resulted in a corpus of thirty-six fully digitized versions of early printed books annotated by “two of the most dedicated readers of the early modern period: John Dee and Gabriel Harvey”. Considering himself a scholar of science, the marginalia composed by Dee feature tables, charts, and diagrams to make sense of what he read. In contrast, Harvey was a humanist and approached his selection of reading as such with passages highlighted through underlining and notes connecting the text to other works read. - A collection of Early Modern annotated books compiled by the William Andrews Clark Memorial Library at the University of California, Los Angeles which span from the 15th century up until the early 19th century. The marginalia of this collection are the most diverse of these sources, containing the scrawl of not only scholars, but printers and other members of the community as well. If the dataset depicts people, are any specific subgroups of people represented? Are any specific individuals personally identifiable? (Gebru et al., 2020) - N/A If the dataset depicts people, are any individuals still living? Does this project comply with privacy laws in countries where it will be shared? - N/A What medium is the dataset? (image, video, text, web archive, etc.) - This dataset is composed of scanned pages of books, extracted from GLAM archives through webscraping How large is the dataset, both in cardinality and in disk storage? - In total, 353 images of early modern book pages were annotated. - For training, added in to this set of images was 20 [negative examples], that is, pages which contain no marginalia. - This set of images was then randomly split using an 85/15 training/test ratio, with 317 (~85%) images being used to train the model, 39 (~10%) images being used to validate the model while it trains, and 17 (~5%) images to test the results of the trained model. - YOLOv7 recommends 1500 images per new class, so to give this small dataset a fighting chance at successfully detecting marginalia, I applied various transformations to the original training images to create augmented versions of this data. These transformations modified the images in ways that preserve their essential features but introduce variation that can enhance the model’s ability to generalize. Not only does data augmentation increase the amount of training data by by generating multiple versions of each original image, but also by presenting the model with different variations of the same image (e.g., different rotations, flips, translations, zoom levels, etc.), data augmentation helps the model learn to recognize important patterns and features that are invariant to those transformations. At the same time, it also helps prevent the model from memorizing specific details of the training data which results in “overfitting”– [we] want a model that detects meaningful and relevant features rather than memorizing specific examples. - In the context of this case study, each of the 317 training images were augmented through added noise, randomly changed contrast, randomly changed brightness, and randomly changed saturation. This expanded the total training image set to 1585 (317*4). - Within the greater context of machine learning, this dataset is very small at only 795 MB. What metadata is available for the dataset items? (Holland et al., 2018) - During the process of scraping and storing the page scans, the metadata associated with the archival item, usually about the book which the page is apart of, was also scraped and embedded within the image using Python’s PIL library. Within my annotation app, the EXIF information is also extracted from each image uploaded. This metadata is viewable in-app, but also within the app’s save file, which is simply a JSON file. Does copyright impact this dataset? If so, how? (Cordell, 2020; Gebru et al., 2020; Jakeway et al., 2020; Padilla, 2018) - All data used falls in the public domain and is only being used for research purposes. Further, there appears to be no restrictions from any of the archives indicating that the extracted images cannot be shared in a research context, thus the dataset can be made accessible on an unmonetized platform. Does this dataset pertain to a difficult history? If so, what extra precautions are being taken? - N/A Collecting process and curation rationale (language borrowed from Bender and Friedman (2018)): Who curated the cultural heritage collection from which this dataset is derived? - The NLS Data Foundry’s collection of chapbooks are part of the Lauriston Castle Collection, which is based on the library built up by William Robert Reid (1854-1919), a wealthy Edinburgh businessman who had acquired Lauriston Castle, on the western outskirts of the city, in 1902.[https://digital.nls.uk/catalogues/special-and-named-printed-collections/?id=598] Reid had been assisted in his book collecting by a family friend, John A Fairley, author of several articles on the bibliography of chapbooks. In the course of his researches Fairley had formed a collection of chapbooks, containing around 500 volumes comprising over 5,500 items, which are now also part of the collection. The chapbooks are organised according to the town where they were printed. The majority of them are Scottish but there are also English and Irish volumes in the collection. - The books that make up the AOR were selected and annotated by a collective of researchers at the Sheridan Libraries, Centre for Editing Lives and Letters, and Princeton University library, however, the lead researchers Earle Havens, Anthony Grafton, and Lisa Jardine likely had the strongest curatorial role. - The Early Modern Annotated Books collection hosted on Calisphere was curated by the William Andrews Clark Memorial Library, which is administered by UCLA’s Center for 17th- &amp; 18th-Century Studies. This rare book and manuscript library specializes in the study of England and the Continent from the Tudor period through the long eighteenth century.[https://calisphere.org/institution/62/collections/] What organization or institution was the collection created for? - The NLS Chapbook dataset was created by the National Library of Scotland’s Digital Scholarship Service, who publishes machine-readable data collections on the NLS’s Data Foundry. - The AOR was created as a collaborative research endeavour to consoldate some of the marginalia produced by Gabriel Harvey and John Dee. - The William Andrews Clark Memorial Library is apart of UCLA’s network of libraries. What funding was utilized (if known)? - NLS’s Data Foundry is a permanant [branch] of their library and thus no specific funding appears to have been secured to produce this data. - The research and development of AOR was conducted with major funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. - The digitization of the Early Modern Annotated Books collection was initially a 2014 pilot project to digitize just ten annotated books from the Clark library, largely shaped by CLIR postdoctoral fellow Philip Palmer. A small grant from the Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation allowed the ten books to be transcribed through the hiring of three graduate students onto the project.62 The further digitzation of annotated books within the Clark’s collections was made possible through funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities, which awarded the library a Humanities Collections and Reference Resources Grant in 2017. What collection process was utilized? (Bender &amp; Friedman, 2018) - The AOR provides the most extensive and transparent description of their collection process, largely in the form of an article on how to “do” AOR yourself, that is, how to replicate their work using a researcher’s own corpus. They do however also summarize the formation of their corpora in brief, by stating that “the composition of the AOR corpora depended on a number of factors, including the costs of digitization, the availability of books, the books owned by partner institutions, and the particular research interests of the scholars involved.”[https://archaeologyofreading.org/how-to-do-aor-yourself/] - Although the NLS does not make their collection process in the context of digitzing materials clear, they do offer information about how the chapbooks which were digtized were aquired. The Lauriston Castle Collection was bequeathed to the Library in 1926 by Mr and Mrs Reid, following the latter’s death that year. This bequest also included the Reid Fund, consisting of £70,000, the income from the estate of Mr and Mrs Reid, which subsequently enabled the Library to acquire printed and manuscript items to add to the national collections.[https://digital.nls.uk/catalogues/special-and-named-printed-collections/?id=598] - The collection process of the William Andrews Clark Memorial Library is opaque; the metadata is largely bibliographic, and some books include a section on provenance, but it is the provenance of the physical item rather than the digtial. When was the collection assembled? (i.e., when were the photographs taken or ethnographies recorded?) - All texts in each collection were created largely during the early modern period, with the oldest printed in the late 15th century and the NLS chapbook collection occasionally featuring chapbooks printed in the 19th century. - On the Data Foundry’s listing for the NLS chapbook dataset, there is only a date stamp for its publication in 2019. However, in the book-level METS data, it states that the chapbooks were captured as part of a project to digitise such in 2015. - According to their data release page, AOR’s collection began assembly in November 2015, and was completed in January 2019. - There is no specific information on the assembly of the Early Modern Annotated Books collection, however based on the funding statement it can be assumed that the books were captured between 2017 until the project’s end in October 2018. What instruments were utilized to create the collection? (i.e., a recording device, camera, etc.) - To gain knowledge of what instruments were used to create the NLS chapbook collection, we once again turn to the METS data, which states that each pages was captured using a Nikon D800E, a popular DSLR camera. - The AOR does not state what technology was used to capture their texts, although they do indicate that the digitization of the books was done primarily in situ by the repositories themselves or through a contract with UCL Digital Media. They do state that they required the images to have a resolution of 600 DPI, so a DSLR camera like that used by the NLS. - There is no clear information provided on the tools used by the William Andrews Clark Memorial Library for digitization. Looking at the EXIF data extracted by my annotation app, there are tags such as [GPS] common in TIFF images that may point to a camera having been used over something like a scanner. If people are included, did individuals consent at the time of collection? - N/A What were the decision-making processes behind the collection’s curation? (Bender &amp; Friedman, 2018) - According to the METS data, the NLS chapbook’s digital form was curated as part of Library activities to make more Scottish collections available online, and chapbooks were selected for this task due to ease as all volumes are the same size. - AOR has the most extensive discussion on the curation of their collection, with dedicated essays on the libraries of Harvey and Dee. Although it is thought that Harvey’s library once contained up to 4000 books, following his death it was dispersed with his books scattered in private, public, and academic libraries around the world.[https://archaeologyofreading.org/gabriel-harvey-his-library-and-the-aor-corpus/] So, the selection of which of his books to digitzed for the AOR project was in large part a practical endeavour; the first books chosen were the nine in the possession of the Princeton University Library, one of their partnering institutions. In addition these nine books, other titles were added to the Harvey AOR corpus often based on factors such as availability (does the binding allow for the book to be digitized?) and the affordability of digitization within a given repository. The Princeton books alone did not form thematic unity, as much as they reflected Harvey’s intellectual interests in topics of warfare, (Roman) history, law, political economy (i.e., husbandry), and linguistics. However, the the inclusion of five other titles alongside those at Princeton allowed for the expansion of the topics and the formation of “clusters” of books: books which thematically overlap, and which may have been read in conjunction with one another, as Harvey enjoyed doing. - While Dee’s library was also dispersed posthumously, and in part, prior to his death due to financial troubles, he created a detailed catalouge of his books at numerous points in his life, which made his pursuits much more easily traceable.[https://archaeologyofreading.org/john-dee-his-library-and-the-aor-corpus/] Like when constructing Harvey’s AOR corpus, factors such as the availability of books and the price charged by the various institutions for their digitization were taken into account, however with more choice being present due to the number of identifiable books annotated by Dee, further decision about what of his library should be digitise relied on intellectual interest. It was decided that primarily, the books selected from Dee should comprise of types and styles of reader interventions that are not represented in the Harvey corpus, as Dee’s corpus contains a number of new interventions, including the use of additional symbols, genealogical trees, complex astrological charts, dense tables, and expansive drawings. Additionally, in order to further reflect a variety of reading and annotation strategies, the AOR Dee corpus also includes lightly annotated books such as Euclid’s Elementorum libri XV, as well as different book formats, ranging from Cicero’s Opera in folio to Gerhard Dorn’s Chymisticum artificium in octavo. Lastly, in relation to Dee’s library as a whole, as in Harvey’s corpus, the books included in Dee’s corpus were selected to reflect the various intellectual interests which Dee pursued throughout his life, including mathematics, astrology/astronomy, medieval history, and New World discovery. The ultimate goal when curating both corpora was an act of balance, reflecting the attempt to cover a representative selection of both readers’ intellectual interests and the ways in which they interacted with their books. - In contrast, there is very little information about the decision-making process made in the curation of Early Modern Annotated Books collection. The choice to digitise annotated books seems to derive from Palmer’s CLIR postdoctoral fellowship on the subject of “Manuscript Annotations in Early Modern Printed Books.”; the project started from a selection of ten annotated books, which Palmer described as being “representative of the characteristic idiosyncrasy that historicdal readers brought to their material readings of books.”63 What is unknown about the collection process and curation rationale? - The NLS’s reasoning for choosing to digitise the chapbooks is very straightforward, and their process of digitisation is made transparent in the METS data included with each chapbook. What is missing, however, from the process of collection and curation is a question of who. In consideration of the original, physical collection of chapbooks, it is not known who owned them prior to Fairley. It is not documented who catalogued the chapbooks prior to digitisation, nor following it, and it is not known who then transformed the chapbooks into the form it takes in NLS’s Data Foundry. - The creation of AOR is extensively documented, and the provenance of each phyiscal book digitised is relatively traceable due to the [fame] of their annotators. The central gap of note in this collection is the process of digitization. This is likely owing to the fact that there were multiple institutions involved in creating the corpora, each having their own digitization process, personnel, and equipment. - The Early Modern Annotated Books collection is the collection which leaves the most unknowns, and this seems to be at least in part due to the focus on the digitized books as being surrogates for the physical object, rather than a “new edition”.64 The metadata associated with each book appears to be about the physical book or where the physical book is within the holding institution, and this notion is affirmed by the Calisphere “statement on digital primary resources”.[https://calisphere.org/overview/] In this statement, these digitzed entries are referred to as primary sources themselves and in their section discussing metadata, they are discussing metadata created from catalouging the physical item rather than from the digital. It seems that this may not have always been the case, given the pilot project which started the Early Modern Annotated Books collection attempted to incorporate elements of the AOR project’s XML schema for the original ten books, however this effort seemed to be abandoned once the project moved past the pilot, and even the XML files and transcribed annotations that did exist appear to be no more, with the link provided in the already obscured blog post describing this process being broken.65 Digitization pipeline (only applicable if the dataset is a digitized version of a physical collection): Who selected what was digitized? - It is unknown who curated the NLS chapbook collection, both physical and digital - Since the content of AOR was assembled and digitised for the project, who selected what was digitsed was the same as those whoo curated the collection. - Philip Palmer selected the first ten books to be digitised for the Clark’s Early Modern Annotated Books collection, however it is unclear exactly which ones. Based on those which he discussed in his 2018 blog post, this ten may have included a copy of Sir Thomas Browne’s Pseudodoxia epidemica, a copy of the 1603 English translation of Montaigne’s Essayes, Richard Allestree’s The Art of Contentment (1675), Aleazar Albin’s The Natural History of English Song-Birds (1779), Sir Richard Blackmore’s Prince Arthur, and Voltaire’s Dictionnaire Philosophique.66 What were the steps in the digitization pipeline? (For example, in the case of photos, what scanners were used to digitize the documents? In the case of documents, what OCR engines were utilized?) - The photos of each chapbook page were captured in the NLS’s Causewayside studio by Picturae, a digitization service provider, using a Nikon D800E camera. In the METS data, it is stated that transcriptions associated with each image file were generated from optical character recognition (OCR) performed by the National Library of Scotland. This itself is vague, but looking more deeply at the METS data, it can be seen that the images for each book were combined into a PDF format using a Luratech PDF application, and in the page level METS data, it is stated that pdfalto, a command line tool for parsing PDF files and producing structured XML representations of the PDF content in ALTO format, was used. - AOR– see above - Calisphere– see above What metadata was algorithmically produced? - None of the archives explicitly indicate that any of their metadata is algorithimically produced, however the NLS chapbook page transcriptions were created through the use of OCR, and the METS file for this collection were evidentally formatted through some sort of unstated automated process. Data provenance: What is the provenance of the dataset, from collection through digitization? (Bender &amp; Friedman, 2018; Diakapoulos et al., n.d.; Holland et al., 2018) - The process of collecting the images which would make up the training dataset Crowd labor: - There was no crowd labour used for this project, however it is important to consider that this project would very much benefit from additional team members, as more images could be annotated and thus a better performing model could be produced. Have volunteers or crowd workers added metadata to the dataset? (Cordell, 2020; Jakeway et al., 2020; Padilla, 2018) If so, how were they recruited and compensated? If so, what metadata did they produce? (i.e., transcriptions, annotations, etc.) Additional modification: Were any additional steps taken after collection curation and digitization in order to produce the dataset in question? (i.e., Were any items removed? Were any additional metadata added? etc.) - There was no additional modifications needed to produce the final dataset. All relevant metadata is present in the project save file created by my application, and since this was… The machine learning model Note: if multiple machine learning models were utilized in the project, this step should be completed for each model. Overview: {What model architecture has been utilized? (Mitchell et al., 2019) + What is the task that the model is being deployed to perform? + Who trained, finetuned, and/or deployed this model? (Mitchell et al., 2019)} - For the purpose of object detection, I chose to use the YOLOv7 model.67 In general, the “You Only Look Once” family of models function by processing the entire image just once to detect objects instead of iteratively analyzing an image multiple times at different scales to identify objects as other object detection models have traditionally done, which makes YOLO models perform the task of object detection faster and more efficiently compared to other models. YOLO models do this by first dividing a picture into a grid of smaller sections, and then for each of these smaller sections, the model tries to predict whether or not there is an object present in that grid, and if so, what kind of object it might be through drawing bounding boxes around the entirety of the possible object and assigning it a label. For each of these boxes drawn, the model will also assign a confidence score, which indicates how sure the model is that an object in that box. If the score is high, it means the model is quite confident, and conversely, if it is low, it is less certain. Lastly, after predicting objects in all of the image’s sections, the model eliminates any object that may have multiple bounding boxes drawn around it using a technique called Non-Maximum Suppression, which selects the best bounding boxes by keeping those with the highest confidence score and removing overlap or redundancy. - Compared to models that break the image down into more granular, pixel-level segmentation, YOLO models’ single-pass approach can struggle with smaller objects or complex scenery, however, should these limitations be considered when creating the training dataset, these issues can be countered through methods such as the addition of negative examples or data augmentation as described previously. Across what organizations or institutions did this training, finetuning, and/or deployment take place? (Mitchell et al., 2019) What funding was utilized? (Gebru et al., 2020) Training/finetuning: Was the model trained from scratch? If so, what data was used to train the model? (Mitchell et al., 2019) If not, was a pre-trained model utilized? Where can more information on the pre-trained model be found? (Mitchell et al., 2019) Was the pre-trained model finetuned? If so, what data was utilized for finetuning? If training or finetuning was performed, what computational resources were utilized? Evaluation: How was the model’s performance evaluated? (Mitchell et al., 2019) What data was used for evaluation? (M. Arnold, Bellamy, et al. (2019); Mitchell et al., 2019) If the model involves data pertaining to people, has the model been audited for fairness and bias using tools such as FairLearn? (M. Arnold, Bellamy, et al. (2019); Bird et al., 2020; Diakapoulos et al., n.d.; Jakeway et al., 2020; Madaio et al. (2020); Reisman et al., 2018) Have any tools been utilized to generate explanations for predictions (i.e., LIME Ribeiro et al. (2016), SHAP Lundberg and Lee (2017), TCAV (Kim et al., 2018)) and modify the model in response? (M. Arnold, Bellamy, et al. (2019); Cordell, 2020; Diakapoulos et al., n.d.; Padilla, 2020; Ribeiro et al., 2020) Deployment: How was the model deployed? Was it used to make a single pass over the cultural heritage dataset in question, or will it be continuously deployed? What computational resources were utilized for deployment? Are the metadata generated by the machine learning model (embeddings, classifications, etc.) available as project deliverables? Release: Has the resulting model been made available for download? (if no, the following questions can be skipped) What license has been provided? (Mitchell et al., 2019) Who are the primary intended users, and what are the intended use cases? (Mitchell et al., 2019) Does this model have applicability outside of cultural heritage collections? What are ways that this model could be misused, either intentionally or unintentionally? (Madaio et al., 2020; Mitchell et al., 2019) Environmental impact: What were the carbon emissions produced by training, finetuning, and/or deploying this model? (Cordell, 2020; Lacoste et al., 2019; Strubell et al., 2019) How does the environmental impact of this model compare to that of other components of the project, such as a collection’s digitization or stakeholders’ flights to relevant conferences? Organizational considerations Stakeholders: What stakeholder groups are involved in this project? (Cordell, 2020) What is each project member’s familiarity with machine learning? (Cordell, 2020; Jakeway et al., 2020) What is each project member’s familiarity with cultural heritage collections as data? Has the project notified and sought input from all potentially relevant stakeholder groups, such as those included within the cultural heritage dataset itself? (Madaio et al., 2020; Reisman et al., 2018) Do groups affected by the project, such as individuals and communities directly represented within the cultural heritage dataset, have an avenue for contacting project staff and seeking recourse? If so, whom should they contact? If not, why not? (Diakapoulos et al., n.d.; Mitchell et al., 2019; Reisman et al., 2018) Use of machine learning: Was it necessary to use machine learning for this project? If so, why? If not, why was machine learning still utilized? What are potential critiques of applying machine learning in this context? Organizational context: Can this project be used to build data fluency within the organization or institution? (Padilla, 2020) Do there exist programs or paths for training staff affiliated with the project to develop machine learning skillsets? (Cordell, 2020; Padilla, 2020) Do there exist programs or paths for training staff affiliated with the project to develop fluency with cultural heritage collections? Project deployment and launch: Who is the target audience of this project? (Madaio et al., 2020) How does the target audience align with the audiences that the institution or organization is hoping to engage? If the target audience of the project is the public, does it make an attempt to educate the public regarding the machine learning approaches employed? Did the project launch reach the intended audience? Has the project received feedback from stakeholders, including the audience? If so, what feedback has been received? Has the launch of the project resulted in any changes to the project?* (* = to be completed post-launch) Copyright, transparency, documentation, maintenance, and privacy Copyright: Building on question 1.1.g, does copyright impact the dataset, model, code, or deliverables for the project? (Cordell, 2020; Gebru et al., 2020; Jakeway et al., 2020; Mitchell et al., 2019; Padilla, 2018) If they are made available, what licenses have been chosen? If they are proprietary, how does this impact re-use? Transparency and re-use: Can the project be audited by outsiders? If so, is there funding available to support outside audits? (Mitchell et al., 2019; Reisman et al., 2018) Is the code created for the project extensible for other cultural heritage researchers? (Padilla, 2020) If so, does the project provide any tutorials or toolkits for re-use? Documentation: Does the project have documentation? (Katell et al., 2019) If so, is the documentation interpretable by the project’s audience? Is the project reproducible to an outside researcher, given the documentation available?
