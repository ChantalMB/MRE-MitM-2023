# Conclusions

-The historiographical impact that using this tool might have in the context of book history and more generally, as the study of history becomes increasingly digital and joins the conversations about transparency and accessible data within the humanities.

Applications of Technical work
- Case study
  - Detection of marginalia in digital collections like EEBO
  - HTR --> https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05929
    - Ultimately was not able to reproduce their results/use their model --> was unable to get their scripts to work with my own data
  - General detection for UCLA Library --> https://github.com/collectionslab/Omniscribe
    - Open source project, could have used their data to augment mine and improve final results, however...[critiques of their method aka machine learning focus over humanities approach, also, who validated the volunteers' annotations? Was there any framework established about what is vs what is not marginalia?]
  - Method could be applied to even more obscure ___ in the history of the Book, such as object marks as discussed by Adam Smyth in his chapter, *Object Traces in Early Modern Books*, although a dataset for training this would be more difficult to create.
  - With enough advancement and perhaps integration with something like HTR, an object detection model could potentially be created that detects the genre of marginalia as outlined by the researcher.
