# Introduction {#intro}

Over the last thirty years historical study has been revolutionized by the rapid emergence of digitized resources which have become widely available to the public, yet techniques which take advantage of the unique digital affordances of such representations are still being developed. A key component of these digitized materials are the metadata which situates them; this metadata describes the object both as a unique digital entity and as the original object it represents. Metadata within to digital archives has been used by scholars such as Ryan Cordell to demonstrate the political and social contexts that form such corpuses of materials. Yet there is other forms of metadata generated when scholars use these digitized resources, particularly when they are adapted for use in a data-forward project, that remain unaccounted for. 

My MRE project develops an approach to capture this missing metadata. I build, and critically situate, an image annotation application for identifying notable material features from digitized documents, with the focus being placed on marginalia composed by readers of these document. The tool functions both manually and automatically, at scale for one document or multiple. Drawing on my experience publishing in The *Programming Historian*, my MRE designs, tests, and describes the tool in such a way that other scholars can immediately deploy it for their own research.[@brousseau_interrogating_2022] Tools used in research are theory-laden in that there are always choices to be made; my MRE situates these choices in such a way that the scholar who uses the tool will understand the consequences for their own research, and make this step of the process more transparent to those consuming the output of their research.

While studying texts of the past, it is not unusual to stumble upon evidence that a document had a ‘life’ before the archive it is currently in; numerous notes throughout the text at the bottom of the page made by the original purchaser, corrections scrawled in rough handwriting from a child using the document as reading practice, or perhaps there is even an initial on the title page left from the document’s first foray into the archive. Indeed, these markings known formally as marginalia not only served a purpose to those who created them, they also serve a purpose for historians through how they may situate a text within its history and allow for a glimpse into the public and private lives of the annotator.

Despite the insights which marginalia can offer historians [of reading, the book, and beyond], it proves to be a challenging subject of study due to its inherent nature as an element residing in the margins, often scorned or overlooked during the archival process. Most studies of marginalia focus on tracing select annotators or on small collections, at least partially due to the difficulty finding marginalia across larger collections when these annotations are neither abundant nor conspicuous. It is this issue of discoverability which my research project will seek to address in the form of a case study, demonstrating the usage of the application I built contextualised within the ongoing discourse surrounding the reconfiguration of digitized cultural heritage collections as data.

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence concerned with creating computer algorithms that "learn" and thus improve automatically through exposure to data. This process results in the creation of a model, which is then able to make predictions or decisions about new data it has not previously seen. Discovery of marginalia across [expansive collections] is an [exemplary] case of when an object detection model should be used; as the name implies, this is a type of machine learning model designed to identify objects in an image.


- But using machine learning has implications in both a [humanities] and technological sense
  - Teaching machines the bad parts of life
  - Environment

- Will apply this machine learning model trained with output from my image annotator to NLS chapbooks...
    - Drawing upon the description the NLS provides on its chapbook collections, these pocket sized pieces of reading material were printed on a single sheet which was then folded into booklets of 8, 12, 16 and 24 pages, continously produced in this manner from the 17th to 19th century. The subject matter of chapbooks was diverse, with sermons of covenanting ministers, prophecies, last words of murderers, and biographies of famous people such as Wallace, Napoleon and Nelson interspresed with works of humour, fairy tales, poetry, not to mention manuals of instruction and almanacs. It has been estimated that around two thirds of chapbooks contain songs and poems, often under the title garlands. Chapbook printers frequently utilized worn and broken type purchased second-hand which naturally produced rough and unrefined prints; likewise, the woodcuts used to decorate chapbooks were also cycled and reused in print, and often were not at all related to the text they were present in. Chapbooks were sold on streets and at fairs for a penny a time by pedlars dubbed 'chapmen', a term that is related to the word 'cheap' but likely also related to the Anglo-Saxon 'ceapian', meaning to barter, buy and sell. Individuals could also buy them directly from printing shops, although one of the features of chapbooks was the proliferation of provincial imprints with places such as Fintray, Falkirk and Inveraray being a common home to cheap print shops. Chapmen were supported by running stationers to make chapbooks, alongside broadsides, the most popular reading material for the masses during the latter half of the early modern period. Chapbooks gradually disappeared in the mid 19th century due to both the rapidly increasing amount of cheap printed content available and the rise of Victorian morality which considered many chapbook publications as crude and profane.

- In creating a model specifically designed to extract marginalia, I will not only demonstrate how an image annotator such as the one I will complete can be used to consolidate metadata and training data, but also demonstrate how this form of image-centered machine learning can facilitate the large-scale study of reader habits and observations across societal ranks during the Early Modern period. The MRE will conclude with a reflection on notable marginalia found within the NLS chapbook collection that can be used as a base for future study, as well as the historiographical impact that using this tool might have in the context of book history and more generally, as the study of history becomes increasingly digital and joins the conversations about transparency and accessible data within the humanities. I intend to make this tool open source through sharing it on Github so that other scholars may use it for their own work or contribute to the code and improve it; the repository will include my MRE and instructions how to use this tool.
