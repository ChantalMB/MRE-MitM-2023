## Presence in Physical and Digital Archives
- How is marginalia defined?
  - In each of the archives I used for analysis/training, what counted as marginalia?
    - AOR included both annotations in the margins, as well as the readers' usage of blank pages (nts what did those pages say? ref Wheelocks...)
