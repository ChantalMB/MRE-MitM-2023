	abstract = {The digital transformation is turning archives, both old and new, into data. As a consequence, automation in the form of artificial intelligence techniques is increasingly applied both to scale traditional recordkeeping activities, and to experiment with novel ways to capture, organise, and access records. We survey recent developments at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and archival thinking and practice. Our overview of this growing body of literature is organised through the lenses of the Records Continuum model. We find four broad themes in the literature on archives and artificial intelligence: theoretical and professional considerations, the automation of recordkeeping processes, organising and accessing archives, and novel forms of digital archives. We conclude by underlining emerging trends and directions for future work, which include the application of recordkeeping principles to the very data and processes that power modern artificial intelligence and a more structural—yet critically aware—integration of artificial intelligence into archival systems and practice.},

	abstract = {A new way of thinking about data science and data ethics that is informed by the ideas of intersectional feminism.
            Today, data science is a form of power. It has been used to expose injustice, improve health outcomes, and topple governments. But it has also been used to discriminate, police, and surveil. This potential for good, on the one hand, and harm, on the other, makes it essential to ask: Data science by whom? Data science for whom? Data science with whose interests in mind? The narratives around big data and data science are overwhelmingly white, male, and techno-heroic. In Data Feminism, Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein present a new way of thinking about data science and data ethics—one that is informed by intersectional feminist thought.
            Illustrating data feminism in action, D'Ignazio and Klein show how challenges to the male/female binary can help challenge other hierarchical (and empirically wrong) classification systems. They explain how, for example, an understanding of emotion can expand our ideas about effective data visualization, and how the concept of invisible labor can expose the significant human efforts required by our automated systems. And they show why the data never, ever “speak for themselves.”
            Data Feminism offers strategies for data scientists seeking to learn how feminism can help them work toward justice, and for feminists who want to focus their efforts on the growing field of data science. But Data Feminism is about much more than gender. It is about power, about who has it and who doesn't, and about how those differentials of power can be challenged and changed.

	abstract = {Marginalia in early modern and medieval texts – printed, handwrit- ten, drawn, scratched, colored, and pasted in – offer a glimpse of how people, as individuals and in groups, interacted with books and manu- scripts over often lengthy periods of time. The chapters in this volume build on earlier scholarship that established marginalia as an intellec- tual method (Grafton and Jardine), as records of reading motivated by cultural, social, theological, and personal inclinations (Brayman [Hackel] and Orgel), and as practices inspired by material affordances particular to the book and the pen (Fleming and Sherman). They further the study of the practices of marginalia as a mode – a set of ways in which material opportunities and practices overlap with intellectual, social, and personal motivations to make meaning in the world. They introduce us to a set of idiosyncratic examples such as the trace marks of objects left in books, deliberately or by accident; cut-and-pasted additions to printed volumes; a marriage depicted through shared book ownership. They reveal to us in case studies the unique value of mar- ginalia as evidence of phenomena as important and diverse as religious change, authorial self-invention, and the history of the literary canon. The chapters of this book go beyond the case study, however, and raise broad historical, cultural, and theoretical questions about the strange, marvelous, metamorphic thing we call the book, and the equally mul- tiplicitous, eccentric, and inscrutable beings who accompany them through history: readers and writers.},

To adequately theorize any research conducted in large-scale text archives—including research that includes primary or secondary sources discovered through keyword search—we must avoid the myth of surrogacy proffered by page images and instead consider directly the text files they overlay. Focusing on the OCR (optical character recognition) from which most large-scale historical text data derives, this article argues that the results of this "automatic" process are in fact new editions of their source texts that offer unique insights into both the historical texts they remediate and the more recent era of their remediation. The constitution and provenance of digitized archives are, to some extent at least, knowable and describable. Just as details of type, ink, or paper, or paratext such as printer's records can help us establish the histories under which a printed book was created, details of format, interface, and even grant proposals can help us establish the histories of corpora created under conditions of mass digitization.},

Adam Crymble mines private and web archives, social media, and

together. Using case studies, Crymble merges histories and
philosophies of the field, separating issues relevant to historians from activities in the broader digital humanities movement. Key
themes include the origin myths of digital historical research; a history of mass digitization of sources; how technology influenced changes in the curriculum; a portrait of the self-learning system that trains historians and the problems with that system; how blogs became a part of outreach and academic writing; and a roadmap for the continuing study of history in the digital era.},

The act of modelling calls our understanding of texts into a remarkable level of self-consciousness and awareness. The challenge to render explicit much of what is left implicit in habitual reading practices or interpretive acts creates frameworks of understanding through these models – schematic abstractions of content, relations, readings and other aspects of textuality. Intellectual insights spring from an encounter with the tasks of creating metadata and mark-up schemes, style sheets and file structures, and in creating the schema that allow a relation between access, storage, display and other features of manipulation. These insights are also useful outside the technical arena, for the cultural import of decisions that modelling puts into place as well as for the way they offer purchase on the process of reading and understanding. This article discusses text modelling in a digital environment as a form of interpretative activity and uses particular case studies that suggest general implications for an understanding of textuality.},

Each element that an encoder might consider using for in-text marginalia, and the customization that proscribes that use, carries different semantic weight. This essay considers the options for encoding marginalia using TEI, details practices of existing projects, and then turns to manuscripts written by Archbishop William Sancroft (1617-1693) as test cases. Ultimately, encoding marginalia is a data-modeling question that asks us to rethink the nature and function of our texts and paratexts, questioning where one ends and the other begins.},

Jackson surveys an extraordinary range of annotated books to explore the history of marginalia, the forms they take, the psychology that underlies them, and the reactions they provoke.Based on a study of thousands of books annotated by readers both famous and obscure over the last three centuries, this book reveals the intensity of emotion that characterizes the process of reading. For hundreds of years, readers have talked to other people in the margins of their books--not only to authors, but also to friends, lovers, and future generations.With an infectious enthusiasm for her subject, Jackson reflects on the cultural and historical value of writing in the margins, examines works that have invited passionate annotation, and presents examples of some of the most provocative marginalia.

While digital history projects increasingly make good and sensitive use of individual and granular records and use them to bring human complexity into a larger analysis, the digitization of published material and archives have mostly been discussed by historians in aggregate: they are valued chiefly for their ability to give us “big data” about phenomena in the past. Yet for those interested in questions and methodologies of microhistory, biographical history, history from below, and other kinds of what we might call “small” history, the digitization of archives and individual records is an equally transformative development. This article will examine the way that digitization has changed how historians discover, concatenate, and communicate small stories in their narratives and arguments. I will consider the practice and the ethics of telling and digitizing individual histories, and I will suggest some different ways of dealing with the new boundaries—and boundlessness—that the “mass digitized turn” throws up, particularly for historians working in the period after 1800. Finally, amidst an increased emphasis on digitization and big data in the field of history, I want to assert the continuing power of all kinds of small histories to explain the past and to connect it to our present, and ourselves.},

	abstract = {This article discusses changing practices brought about by the move to online digital records, the impact these are having on the way history is written, and the way in which archivists are responding (and will need to respond in the future). We argue that digital administrative records are surrounded by other sources – online newspapers and social media – and that the huge volume of digital records alters the way historians read material. This will require a shift in approach from archivists, who will need to view archives as collections of data to be mined and not as texts to be read. Approaches to appraisal will need to be modified, and archivists will need to understand the tools and techniques used to make sense of digital records. While grappling with these issues, archivists will also need to recognize that the future record will be as much about sound and vision as about text. RÉSUMÉCet article aborde les pratiques changeantes occasionnées par le passage vers les documents numériques en ligne, l’impact de ces changements sur la façon dont l’histoire est écrite, et les façons dont les archivistes réagissent (et devront réagir à l’avenir). Nous soutenons que les documents administratifs numériques sont entourés d’autres sources – quotidiens en ligne et médias sociaux – et que la quantité énorme de documents numériques modifie la façon dont les historiens lisent le matériel. Ceci nécessitera un changement dans l’approche des archivistes qui devront voir les archives comme collections de données à exploiter et non comme textes à lire. Les approches en évaluation archivistique devront être modifiées et les archivistes devront bien saisir les outils et techniques qui servent à comprendre les documents numériques. Tout en faisant face à ces questions, les archivistes devront aussi reconnaître que le document d’archives de l’avenir sera autant une question de son et d’images que de texte.},

In spite of its fundamental nature however, data collection remains an overlooked part of the machine learning (ML) pipeline. In this paper, we argue that a new specialization should be formed within ML that is focused on methodologies for data collection and annotation: efforts that require institutional frameworks and procedures. Specifically for sociocultural data, parallels can be drawn from archives and libraries. Archives are the longest standing communal effort to gather human information and archive scholars have already developed the language and procedures to address and discuss many challenges pertaining to data collection such as consent, power, inclusivity, transparency, and ethics \& privacy. We discuss these five key approaches in document collection practices in archives that can inform data collection in sociocultural ML. By showing data collection practices from another field, we encourage ML research to be more cognizant and systematic in data collection and draw from interdisciplinary expertise.},

	abstract = {In a recent sale catalog, one bookseller apologized for the condition of a sixteenth-century volume as "rather soiled by use." When the book was displayed the next year, the exhibition catalogue described it as "well and piously used [with] marginal notations in an Elizabethan hand [that] bring to life an early and earnest
owner"; and the book's buyer, for his part, considered it to be
"enlivened by the marginal notes and comments." For this collector, as for an increasing number of cultural historians and historians of the book, a marked-up copy was more interesting than one in
pristine condition.

William H. Sherman recovers a culture that took the phrase "mark my words" quite literally. Books from the first two centuries of
printing are full of marginalia and other signs of engagement and use, such as customized bindings, traces of food and drink,
penmanship exercises, and doodles. These marks offer a vast archive of information about the lives of books and their place in the
lives of their readers.

Based on a survey of thousands of early printed books, {\textless}em{\textgreater}Used
Books{\textless}/em{\textgreater} describes what readers wrote in and around their books and what we can learn from these marks by using the tools of
archaeologists as well as historians and literary critics. The
chapters address the place of book-marking in schools and churches, the use of the "manicule" (the ubiquitous hand-with-pointing-finger symbol), the role played by women in information management, the
extraordinary commonplace book used for nearly sixty years by
Renaissance England's greatest lawyer-statesman, and the attitudes toward annotated books among collectors and librarians from the
Middle Ages to the present.

This wide-ranging, learned, and often surprising book will make the marks of Renaissance readers more visible and legible to scholars, collectors, and bibliophiles.},

Printed almanacs were often interleaved with blank pages, onto which readers added notes of their activities: journeys; illnesses; resolutions. By examining a number of annotated almanacs, and by focusing in particular on the Civil War almanacs of Lady Isabella Twysden, this essay examines the relationship between printed almanac and manuscript annotations, and the connection between annotated almanacs and those categories which organise recent critical discussions of life-writing: identity, subjectivity, autobiography, diary, self. Materials added to almanacs were often later transferred to other texts: diarists often generated a life through a process of shunting material from text to text, starting with an almanac, expanding records with each movement. The production of diaries was less about directly transcribing lived experience, and more the result of revising prior texts. Many features of diaries can be explained through reference back to the almanac as a first or early site where notes on a life began. This founding compositional moment shaped later diaries: the expectations the almanac created, the subjects and vocabularies it induced, informed later written lives.},

This article shows how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be used to categorize and analyze digitized historical visual sources. We present three different approaches to using CNNs for gaining a deeper understanding of visual trends in an archive of digitized Dutch newspapers. These include detecting medium-specific features (separating photographs from illustrations), querying images based on abstract visual aspects (clustering visually similar advertisements), and training a neural network based on visual categories developed by domain experts. We argue that CNNs allow researchers to explore the visual side of the digital turn. They allow archivists and researchers to classify and spot trends in large collections of digitized visual sources in radically new ways.},

One of the most commonplace aspects of old books is the fact that people wrote in them, something that, until very recently, has infuriated modern collectors and librarians. But these inscriptions constitute a significant dimension of the book's history, and what readers did to books often added totheir value. Sometimes marks in books have no relation to the subject of the book, merely names, dates, prices paid; blank spaces were used for pen trials and doing sums, and flyleaves are occasionally the repository of records of various kinds. The Reader in the Book deals with that special class of booksin which the text and marginalia are in intense communication with each other, in which reading constitutes an active and sometimes adversarial engagement with the book. The major examples are works that are either classics or were classics in their own time; but they are seen here as contemporaries read them, without the benefit of centuries of commentary and critical guidance. The underlying question is at what point marginalia, the legible incorporation of the work of reading into the textof the book, became a way of defacing it rather than of increasing its value-why did we want books to lose their history?},

	abstract = {In a recent sale catalog, one bookseller apologized for the condition of a sixteenth-century volume as "rather soiled by use." When the book was displayed the next year, the exhibition catalogue described it as "well and piously used [with] marginal notations in an Elizabethan hand [that] bring to life an early and earnest
owner"; and the book's buyer, for his part, considered it to be
"enlivened by the marginal notes and comments." For this collector, as for an increasing number of cultural historians and historians of the book, a marked-up copy was more interesting than one in
pristine condition.

William H. Sherman recovers a culture that took the phrase "mark my words" quite literally. Books from the first two centuries of
printing are full of marginalia and other signs of engagement and use, such as customized bindings, traces of food and drink,
penmanship exercises, and doodles. These marks offer a vast archive of information about the lives of books and their place in the
lives of their readers.

Based on a survey of thousands of early printed books, {\textless}em{\textgreater}Used
Books{\textless}/em{\textgreater} describes what readers wrote in and around their books and what we can learn from these marks by using the tools of
archaeologists as well as historians and literary critics. The
chapters address the place of book-marking in schools and churches, the use of the "manicule" (the ubiquitous hand-with-pointing-finger symbol), the role played by women in information management, the
extraordinary commonplace book used for nearly sixty years by
Renaissance England's greatest lawyer-statesman, and the attitudes toward annotated books among collectors and librarians from the
Middle Ages to the present.

This wide-ranging, learned, and often surprising book will make the marks of Renaissance readers more visible and legible to scholars, collectors, and bibliophiles.},

	abstract = {“Cultural Graphology” could be the name of a new human science: this was Derrida’s speculation when, in the late 1960s, he imagined a discipline that combined psychoanalysis, deconstruction, and a commitment to the topic of writing. He never undertook the project himself but did leave two brief sketches of how he thought cultural graphology might proceed. In this book, Juliet Fleming picks up where Derrida left off. Using both his early and later thought, and the psychoanalytic texts to which it is addressed, to examine the print culture of early modern England, she drastically unsettles some key assumptions of book history.  Fleming shows that the single most important lesson to survive from Derrida’s early work is that we do not know what writing is. Channeling Derrida’s thought into places it has not been seen before, she examines printed errors, spaces, and ornaments (topics that have hitherto been marginal to our accounts of print culture) and excavates the long-forgotten reading practice of cutting printed books. Proposing radical deformations to the meanings of fundamental and apparently simple terms such as “error,” “letter,” “surface,” and “cut,” Fleming opens up exciting new pathways into our understanding of writing all told.},

Though the cultural heritage community has collectively developed an emerging body of work detailing responsible operations for machine learning in galleries, museums, archives, and libraries at the organizational level, there remains a paucity of guidelines created for researchers embarking on machine learning projects with digital collections. The manifold stakes and sensitivities involved in applying machine learning to cultural heritage underscore the importance of developing such guidelines. This article contributes to this need by formulating a detailed checklist with guiding questions and practices that can be employed while developing a machine learning project that utilizes cultural heritage data. I call the resulting checklist the “Collections as ML Data” checklist, which, when completed, can be published with the deliverables of the project. By surveying existing projects, including my own project, Newspaper Navigator, I justify the “Collections as ML Data” checklist and demonstrate how the formulated guiding questions can be employed by researchers.},

	abstract={We may observe a growing preoccupation in archival literature with characterizing digital archives as big data – a term that suitably captures both their scale and their potential for manipulation through the application of computational methods and techniques for the purposes of discovering new insights. The possibilities for working with digital archives as data, from supporting archival arrangement and description tasks to promoting the use of digital archives as data sets by researchers, are indeed encouraging. But what are digital archives becoming when they are reframed as data, big or otherwise? What consequences might such a conceptualization have for the ways archival professionals imagine their role and their work? To the four archival paradigms of evidence, memory, identity, and community theorized by Terry Cook, a fifth may now be poised to emerge: an archives-as-data paradigm. In this article, I begin to map out what an archives-as-data paradigm could entail by exploring how the conceptual and practical dimensions of applying computational methods to digital archives may work conservatively to revivify notions of archival neutrality. For an archives-as- data paradigm to realize the more liberatory aims of which it is capable, an active and ongoing commitment to recognizing and calling out these tendencies is necessary.Alternate abstract: On peut dénoter, dans la littérature archivistique, une préoccupation croissante quant à la qualification des archives numériques comme données massives – une terminologie qui souligne bien à la fois leur taille et leur potentiel à être manipulées par l’utilisation de méthodes et de techniques informatiques pour en extraire de nouvelles idées. Les possibilités d’utiliser les archives numériques comme données – de l’aide apportée aux tâches de classification et de description archivistique à la promotion de l’utilisation par les chercheurs des archives numériques en tant qu’ensemble de données – sont, en effet, encourageantes. Mais que deviennent les archives numériques lorsqu’elles sont redéfinies comme données, massives ou autres? Quelles conséquences une telle conceptualisation peut-elle avoir sur la façon dont les professionnels des archives pensent leur rôle et leur travail? Aux quatre paradigmes archivistiques de preuve, de mémoire, d’identité et de communauté, théorisés par Terry Cook, pourrait s’ajouter un cinquième: le paradigme de l’archive comme donnée (archives-as-data). Dans cet article je tente d’abord d’établir ce que pourrait signifier un paradigme d’archive comme donnée en explorant la façon dont les dimensions conceptuelles et pratiques de l’emploi de méthodes informatiques sur les archives numériques peuvent servir, à tout le moins, à raviver les notions de neutralité des archives. Pour qu’un paradigme d’archive comme donnée soit en mesure de produire, dans toute son ampleur, l’effet libérateur recherché, un engagement actif et soutenu à repérer et désigner ces tendances est nécessaire.},

Since they are highly data-driven, relying on billion-sized datasets randomly scraped from the internet, they also suffer, as we demonstrate, from degenerated and biased human behavior. In turn, they may even reinforce such biases. To help combat these undesired side effects, we present safe latent diffusion (SLD). Specifically, to measure the inappropriate degeneration due to unfiltered and imbalanced training sets, we establish a novel image generation test bed-inappropriate image prompts (I2P)-containing dedicated, real-world image-to-text prompts covering concepts such as nudity and violence. As our exhaustive empirical evaluation demonstrates, the introduced SLD removes and suppresses inappropriate image parts during the diffusion process, with no additional training required and no adverse effect on overall image quality or text alignment.},
